India's rupee hits five-year highIndia's rupee has hit a five-year high after Standard & Poor's (S&P) raised the country's foreign currency rating. India's foreign currency rating is now one notch below investment grade, which starts at 'BBB-'. With Indian assets now seen as less of a gamble, more cash is expected to flow into its markets, buoying the rupee. The rupee climbed to 43.305 per US dollar on Thursday, up from a close of 43.41.
