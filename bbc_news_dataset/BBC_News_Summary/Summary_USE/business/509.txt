Euro firms miss out on optimismMore than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests. But PwC's global chief executive, Samuel DiPiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers. There is one exception: Firms in Western Europe - but not the UK - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. According to Frank Brown, global advisory leader at PwC , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: "One risk in one region - for example the Middle East - will not kill your business anymore." When business advisers PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects. Global business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault.
