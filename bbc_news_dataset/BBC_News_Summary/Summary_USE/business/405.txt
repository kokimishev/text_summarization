The bank said that the recent pattern of house prices rising the fastest in the north of England continued in December. The UK's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. Last week, the Nationwide said that house prices fell 0.2% in December, with annual inflation running at a three year low. Capital Economics, which has in the past predicted a sharp fall in UK house prices, branded Halifax's findings a "temporary surprise," which would be reversed over the coming months. "The month by month volatility of the Halifax house price data should not distract from the fact that there is a clear downward trend in house prices," a Capital Economics statement said. House prices rebound says HalifaxUK house prices increased by 1.1% in December, the first monthly rise since September, the Halifax has said. As a result, annual house price inflation dipped below 20% during the final few months of 2004.
