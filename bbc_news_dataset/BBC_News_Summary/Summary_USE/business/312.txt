The unidentified Parmalat source also told Reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions. The firm collapsed with debts of about 14bn euros ($19bn; Â£10bn) and new boss Enrico Bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders. Under Italian law, administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency, if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble. In the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company, among other things, had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet. Parmalat was declared insolvent in December 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist.
