Boeing has set itself a target of getting 200 firm commitments for the 7E7 by the end of this year, and has orders for 56 so far. Airbus hopes to have 50 orders in place for the A350 by mid-2005. Japan Airlines has made a firm order for 30 of the aircraft, at $120m each, with the option to buy 20 more. Airbus this week announced the first pre-sale of its 7E7 rival - the A350. Boeing continues to enjoy a dominance over Airbus in Japan, and Japanese companies are taking key roles in building the 7E7.
