Brazil's airport authority chief Carlos Wilson had claimed the government was on the brink of stepping in to save Varig, Brazil's flagship airline. Brazil plays down Varig rescueThe Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline. The airline could also win a sizeable windfall from a compensation claim against the government. The depreciation of Brazil's currency has had a direct impact on the airline's dollar debt as well as some of its costs. However, the country's vice president Jose Alencar has said the government still is looking for a solution. For that to happen Varig's main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline's employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said.
