And he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like Yukos - a technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. The privatisation of companies such as Yukos in the 1990s had been badly handled, he said. Economy minister German Gref told the Kommersant newspaper that direct state involvement in oil was "unjustified". His comments follow the sale of much of oil giant Yukos to cover back taxes - a deal which effectively took most of the firm's assets into public ownership. Mr Gref also poured cold water on President Putin's promises of doubled economic growth within a decade. On 28 December, another senior economic adviser called the sale "the swindle of the century". "The task is not simply to double GDP; instead it is to use GDP to qualitatively improve people's lives," Mr Gref told Kommersant.
