MCI shares climb on takeover bidShares in US phone company MCI have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks. A merger between MCI and Qwest would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. Other firms have also expressed an interest in MCI, the second-largest US long-distance phone firm, and may now table rival bids, analysts said. The largest US telephone company Verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with MCI, Reuters quoted sources as saying. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Qwest has bid $6.3bn (Â£3.4bn) for MCI. Buying MCI would give Qwest, a local phone service provider, access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers.
