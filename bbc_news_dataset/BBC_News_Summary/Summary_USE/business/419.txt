$1m payoff for former Shell bossShell is to pay $1m (Â£522,000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in April 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves. In January 2004, Shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. Judy Boynton finally left the firm on 31 December, having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive Jeroen van der Veer. Despite receiving an email from Mr Van de Vijver which said the firm had "fooled" the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further. She was leaving "by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities", the firm said in a statement.
