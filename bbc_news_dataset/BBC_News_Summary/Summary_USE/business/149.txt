Beyond the 12,000 job cuts announced last year at its European operations, GM is reducing expenditure by building Saabs, Opels - badged as Vauxhalls in the UK - and now Cadillacs on the same framework, and by allowing the different brands to share parts. GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. As part of its efforts to make the US marque appeal to European drivers, the car will be the first Cadillac with a diesel engine. In a separate announcement, GM unveiled a new scheme to allow European consumers the chance to test drive its Opel and Vauxhall models. Bringing Cadillac production to Sweden should help introduce desperately-needed scale to the Saab factory, which currently produces fewer than 130,000 cars per year. For years, Saab has consistently said it is competing head-on with BMW, Mercedes and Jaguar.
