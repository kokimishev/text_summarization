Crude oil prices back above $50Cold weather across parts of the United States and much of Europe has pushed US crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months. Several Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. Opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market. A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. The arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of US crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year. "The dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it," said Chris Furness, senior market strategist at 4Cast.
