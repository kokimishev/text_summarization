Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said: "This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy." The ONS says gross domestic product (GDP) rose by a strong 0.7% in the three months to 31 December, compared with 0.5% in the previous quarter. However, output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. UK economy ends year with spurtThe UK economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the UK economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter. The figure is in line with Treasury and Bank of England forecasts. However the ONS would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over.
