Jobs growth still slow in the USThe US created fewer jobs than expected in January, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years. Analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory. Nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since September 2001. According to Labor Department figures, US firms added only 146,000 jobs in January.
