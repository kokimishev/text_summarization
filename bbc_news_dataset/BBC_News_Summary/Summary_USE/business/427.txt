Chinese exports rise 25% in 2004Exports from China leapt during 2004 over the previous year as the country continued to show breakneck growth. The US's overall trade deficit with China was $124bn in 2003, and is expected to rise to about $150bn for 2004. The figures released by the Ministry of Commerce come as China's tax chief confirmed that growth had topped 9% in 2004 for the second year in a row. The spurt put China's trade surplus - a sore point with some of its trading partners - at a six-year high. According to the Ministry of Commerce, China's exports totalled $63.8bn in December, taking the annual total up 35.4% to $593.4bn.
