Howard Archer, economist at Global Insight said the MPC "may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside". Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec Securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. Economists see next week's inflation report from the MPC as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check. Inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in December - its highest level in six months. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said it was "concerned by the clamour in some quarters" for early interest rate increases. Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the MPC that rates should be left unchanged in recent months.
