German business confidence slidesGerman business confidence fell in February knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in Europe's largest economy. Economy and Labour Minister Wolfgang Clement called the dip in February's Ifo confidence figure "a very mild decline". Analysts said that the Ifo figures and Germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the European Central Bank. Latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and Ifo president Hans-Werner Sinn said any improvement in German domestic demand was sluggish. Germany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. However, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend.
