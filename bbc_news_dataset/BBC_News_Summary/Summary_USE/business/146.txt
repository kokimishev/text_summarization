For many economists and analysts they are about ensuring Europe does not become a global economic laggard. The circumstances were not conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by EU leaders in Lisbon in 2000. That's why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. But some analysts believe that the Kok report does not come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the Lisbon targets a reality. The report comes at a time when Europe's competitive position is waning. Mr Barroso has said that the EU's competitiveness will be his top priority. The European economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception. "It's very ambitious," said John Palmer, political director at the European Policy Centre, a Brussels-based think-tank. They are also about ensuring Europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of Asia, India and China, as well as with the economic might of the United States. The EU's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next.
