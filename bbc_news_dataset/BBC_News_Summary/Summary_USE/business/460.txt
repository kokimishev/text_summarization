Jobs go at Oracle after takeoverOracle has announced it is cutting about 5,000 jobs following the completion of its $10.3bn takeover of its smaller rival Peoplesoft last week. "By retaining the vast majority of Peoplesoft technical staff, Oracle will have the resources to deliver on the development and support commitments we have made to Peoplesoft customers over the last 18 months," Oracle's chief executive Larry Ellison said in a statement. The company said it would retain more than 90% of Peoplesoft product development and product support staff. Oracle's 18-month fight to acquire Peoplesoft was one of the most drawn-out and hard-fought US takeover battles of recent times. They say Mr Ellison may be trying to placate Peoplesoft customers riled by Oracle's determined takeover strategy. Other employees said they would rather be sacked than work for Oracle.
