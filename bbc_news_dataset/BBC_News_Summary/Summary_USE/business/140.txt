Shares in Germany's ThyssenKrupp, the UK's Corus and France's Arcleor fell while Japan's Nippon Steel slid after it agreed to pay 72% more for iron ore. China's Baoshan Iron and Steel Co. said it was delaying a share sale because of weak market conditions, adding it would raise steel prices to offset ore costs. The share price fall was initially triggered by news that two of the world's biggest iron ore suppliers had negotiated contracts at much-higher prices. China's Baoshan, the country's largest steel producer, said that the uncertainty surrounding the industry has prompted it to pull its planned share sale. Steel analyst Peter Fish, director of Sheffield-based consulting group MEPS, said the extent of CVRD's price rise was "uncharted territory", adding that the steel industry "has not seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years". Steel prices rose by 8% globally in January alone and by 24% in China. Analysts now expect other iron ore producers, such as Australia's BHP Billiton, to seek annual price rises of up to 70%. Baoshan stock climbed on news of the delay and its decision to increase the price of its steel by 10%.
