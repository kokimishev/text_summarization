Earlier this week China said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail. Internationally recognized regulation is now a key part of China's plans for developing its economy, analysts said. The problem of piracy is not limited to China, however, and the potential for profit is huge. Despite the fact that product piracy is a major problem, foreign companies have only occasionally won cases and the compensation awarded has usually been small. Beijing also has been threatened with sanctions if it fails to clamp down. Last month the EU said it will start monitoring China, Ukraine and Russia to ensure they are going after pirated goods.
