Sri Lanka is hoping for a wider freeze from other creditors. A full reckoning of the economic cost to Sri Lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come. According to Mr Mendis, half the IMF support could come from a freeze on debt repayments, which would free up resources immediately. One side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country. This estimate is preliminary, bank governor Sunil Mendis told reporters, and could rise in 2006.
