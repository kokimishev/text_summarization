The High Street retailer said it now expected to report annual profits of between £415m and £425m ($779m-798m). Weak end-of-year sales hit NextNext has said its annual profit will be £5m lower than previously expected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing. Overall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up 12.4%, Next said. Mr Wolfson also said that disappointing pre-Christmas sales were "more to do with the fact that we went in with too much stock rather than (the fact that) demand was not there for the stock". Like-for-like sales growth at the 49 Next stores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was 0.5%. "Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations," the company said.
