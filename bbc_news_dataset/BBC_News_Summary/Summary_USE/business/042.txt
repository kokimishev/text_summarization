The recent rise in coal prices has failed to benefit the company as most of its output had already been sold, it said. UK Coal said it was making "significant progress" in shaking up the business. UK Coal plunges into deeper lossShares in UK Coal have fallen after the mining group reported losses had deepened to £51.6m in 2004 from £1.2m. The UK's biggest coal producer blamed geological problems, industrial action and "operating flaws" at its deep mines for its worsening fortunes. Total production costs were £1.30 per gigajoule, UK Coal said, but the average selling price was just £1.18 per gigajoule.
