John Gill, managing director of the insurer's life and pensions division, said that a strong stock market recovery in the past two years had only "partly compensated for losses during 2001 and 2002". It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. Slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates. In addition, low interest rates meant that "long-term investment returns are well below historic levels", Mr Gill added.
