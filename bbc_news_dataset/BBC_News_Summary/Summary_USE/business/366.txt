Grant Samuel said its valuation of WMC was based on lower average prices for nickel, copper and uranium than current market levels. And WMC chief executive Andrew Michelmore claimed the Xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for Xstrata's shareholders, and was not being made for the benefit of WMC's shareholders. A report from investment firm Grant Samuel in WMC defence documents values WMC shares at A$7.17 to A$8.24, against Xstrata's bid of A$6.35 a share. WMC says Xstrata bid is too lowAustralian mining firm WMC Resources has said it is worth up to 30% more than a hostile 7.4bn Australian dollar ($5.8bn; Â£3bn) bid by rival Xstrata. In 2003 Xstrata acquired Australia's largest copper miner - MIM Holdings. He said the valuation would put increased pressure on Xstrata to look at "sweetening" its offer. On Tuesday, WMC chairman Tommie Bergman said in a statement the directors believed it was in shareholders' best interest to reject the offer.
