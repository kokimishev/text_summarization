Britannia members' £42m windfallMore than 800,000 Britannia Building Society members are to receive a profit share worth on average £52 each. Last year, Britannia members shared £42m, but the average payment was only £38. To qualify for the profit share, members must have either a mortgage, or an investment account other than a deposit account. The profit share scheme was introduced in 1997 and has paid out more than £370m. Britannia has also stopped making payments to members if they are worth less than £5.
