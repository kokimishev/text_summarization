Saudi NCCI's shares soarShares in Saudi Arabia's National Company for Cooperative Insurance (NCCI) soared on their first day of trading in Riyadh. The listing was part of the country's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector. However, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance. Demand for the insurer's debut shares was strong - 12 times what was on sale. Previously, only NCCI has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within Saudi Arabia.
