Stores received a boost from bargain hunters but trading then reverted to December levels, the British Retail Consortium and accountants KPMG said. In the three-months to January, like-for-like sales showed a growth rate of -0.1%, the same as in the three months to December, the BRC said. But clothing and footwear sales were said to be generally better than December, while department stores also had a good month.

Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, compared with a year earlier.
