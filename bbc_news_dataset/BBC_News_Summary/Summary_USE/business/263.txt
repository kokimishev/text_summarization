Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to Â£350m in compensation. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. "This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome," Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News.
