Mr Myers has admitted that he ordered false accounting entries at the request of former Worldcom chief financial officer Scott Sullivan. Worldcom boss 'left books alone'Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers, who is accused of overseeing an $11bn (Â£5.8bn) fraud, never made accounting decisions, a witness has told jurors. Defence lawyers have been trying to paint Mr Sullivan, who has admitted fraud and will testify later in the trial, as the mastermind behind Worldcom's accounting house of cards. Mr Myers has already pleaded guilty to fraud and is assisting prosecutors. Mr Ebbers' trial is expected to last two months and if found guilty the former CEO faces a substantial jail sentence. David Myers made the comments under questioning by defence lawyers who have been arguing that Mr Ebbers was not responsible for Worldcom's problems.
