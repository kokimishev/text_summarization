The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said retail sales rose 0.6% on the month and 6.1% on the year. However, recent data from the British Retail Consortium showed a 0.2% slip in High Street sales during November. However, retailers' attempts to draw in the crowds may be behind November's unexpected rise in sales, they say. Many had expected sales to fall slightly in November as shoppers put off buying Christmas presents until December.
