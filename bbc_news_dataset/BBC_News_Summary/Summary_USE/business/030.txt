If the oil price does not rise any further, then we think the shock can be absorbed within the next few quarters," Vincent Koen, a senior economist with the OECD, told the BBC's World Business Report. A dip in oil prices and improving jobs prospects would improve consumer confidence and spending, the OECD said. However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum. Soaring oil 'hits world economy'The soaring cost of oil has hit global economic growth, although world's major economies should weather the storm of price rises, according to the OECD. Overall, the report forecast total growth of 3.6% in 2004 for the 30 member countries of the OECD, slipping to 2.9% next year before recovering to 3.1% in 2006. "There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future," said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD's chief economist.
