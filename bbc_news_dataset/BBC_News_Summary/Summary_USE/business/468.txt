Both the Italian government and Alitalia have repeatedly denied that the money - part of a vital restructuring plan - is state aid. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition. The matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia. EU to probe Alitalia 'state aid'The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid. Commission officials are to look at Rome's provision of a 400m euro ($495m; Â£275m) loan to the carrier. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997.
