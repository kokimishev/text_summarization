In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Sina said its shares were purchased between 12 January and 10 February for about $230m. The move may be a precursor to a full takeover, with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in Sina. Rumours about a possible takeover boosted Sina's shares by more than 10% on Friday. Sina said that the purchase of a stake by Shanda would have no impact on its business. The board of directors said in a statement that it would "continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers".
