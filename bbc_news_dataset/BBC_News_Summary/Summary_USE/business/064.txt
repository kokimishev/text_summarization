Despite the problems, Mr Lamberty said that it was not certain that Lufthansa would take legal action. The company said that it had to cancel 77 short and medium-distance flights, affecting about 5,000 passengers. Lufthansa said that it may lose millions of euros as a result of Air Force One landing at Frankfurt airport. Mr Lamberty said that 92 outgoing flights and 86 income flights were delayed by an average of an hour following President Bush's arrival, affecting almost 17,000 passengers. Flights were affected for an hour on Wednesday morning, double the time that had been expected, leading to cancellations and delays.
