Palestinian economy in declineDespite a short-lived increase in Palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a World Bank report. However, during the first half of this year, the Palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs. Unemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago. According to the report, Intifada, Closures and Palestinian Economic Crisis: An Assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and Palestinian economic problems. "Closures are a key factor behind today's economic crisis in the West Bank," said Nigel Roberts, World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza.
