Prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking. The tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. Prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. Among the firms accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. A three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.
