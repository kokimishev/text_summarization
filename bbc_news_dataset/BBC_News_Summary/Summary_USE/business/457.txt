A number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone's rules. "The stability pact will work better if intervention by European institutions in the budgetary sovereignty of national parliaments is only permitted under very limited conditions," he wrote. The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members. The current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country's deficit to 3% of GDP. Mr Schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3% limit if they met certain criteria.
