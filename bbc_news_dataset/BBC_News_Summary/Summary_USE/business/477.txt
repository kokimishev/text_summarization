JP Morgan admits US slavery linksThousands of slaves were accepted as collateral for loans by two banks that later became part of JP Morgan Chase. "We all know slavery existed in our country, but it is quite different to see how our history and the institution of slavery were intertwined," JP Morgan chief executive William Harrison and chief operating officer James Dimon said in the letter. About 13,000 slaves were used as loan collateral between 1831 and 1865. The admission is part of an apology sent to JP Morgan staff after the bank researched its links to slavery in order to meet legislation in Chicago. "We apologise to the African-American community, particularly those who are descendants of slaves, and to the rest of the American public for the role that Citizens Bank and Canal Bank played."
