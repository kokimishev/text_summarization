The government hopes that the new currency will cement the country's economic progress, two weeks after EU leaders set a date for the start of Turkey's accession talks. Turkey knocks six zeros off liraTurkey is to relaunch its currency on Saturday, knocking six zeros off the lira in the hope of boosting trade and powering its growing economy. "The transition to the new Turkish lira shows clearly that our economy has broken the vicious circle that it was imprisoned in for long years," said Sureyya Serdengecti, head of the Turkish Central Bank. "The Turkish lira has been like funny money," Tevfik Aksoy, chief Turkish economist for Deutsche Bank, told Associated Press. The Turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs. On an everyday level, it is hoped the change will stimulate more international trade and end confusion among foreign investors and Turks alike. "The new lira is also the symbol of the stable economy that we dreamed of for long years."
