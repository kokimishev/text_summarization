The finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting, while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace. In order for a virtual office to succeed, keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. The walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed, and the walls should be painted in a light colour. In order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating, power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. As for lighting, consider a combination of floor mounted uplights, wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. The layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. Prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight, and the structure is checked for stability. Referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. Use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior. Large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available.
