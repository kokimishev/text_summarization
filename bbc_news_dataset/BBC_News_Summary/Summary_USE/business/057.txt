Private sector business surveys suggest a stronger economy than official estimates, Ms Lomax said. "Recent work by the Bank has shown that private sector surveys add value, even when preliminary ONS estimates are available," Ms Lomax said in a speech to the North Wales Business Club. Economy 'stronger than forecast'The UK economy probably grew at a faster rate in the third quarter than the 0.4% reported, according to Bank of England deputy governor Rachel Lomax. Other surveys collectively show a rapid slowdown in UK house price growth, she pointed out. Her remarks follow criticism from the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee, which said the MPC had held interest rates too high given that inflation was way below the 2% target. This means that despite a strong economic growth, base rates will probably stay on hold at 4.75%. "The MPC judges that overall growth was a little higher in the third quarter than the official data currently indicate," Ms Lomax said.
