Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told government departments to put plans in place for employing women. "Our educational reforms have created a new generation of highly-educated and professionally trained Saudi women who are acquiring their rightful position in Saudi society," Arab News quoted Prince Saud as saying. Women now make up more than half of all graduates from Saudi universities but only 5% of the workforce. Earlier this week, the local Arab News said Labour Minister Ghazi al-Gosaibi had "caused uproar" when he said his ministry was having difficulty hiring women because they demanded segregated offices.
