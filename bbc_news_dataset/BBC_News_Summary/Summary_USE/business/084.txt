Remittances now represent more than 2% of the country's GDP, according to the Bank of Mexico's figures. The Bank of Mexico said that remittances grew 24% last year and now represent the country's second-biggest source of income after oil. The Inter-American Development Bank estimates that remittances to Latin America and the Caribbean reached $45bn in 2004. Remittance charges are estimated to have dropped by between 50 and 60%, reports from the US Treasury and the Inter-American Development Bank have said. According to Standard & Poor's, which has recently upgraded Mexico's sovereign debt rating, the rise in remittances helps protect the Mexican economy against a potential fall in the international oil prices.
