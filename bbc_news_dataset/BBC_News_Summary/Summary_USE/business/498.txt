The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.
