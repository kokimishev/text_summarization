The prospect of Fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors, as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future. Fosters buys stake in winemakerAustralian brewer Fosters has bought a large stake in Australian winemaker Southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover. Southcorp's shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target. Fosters bought 18.8% of Southcorp, the global winemaker behind the Penfolds, Lindemans and Rosemount brands, for 4.17 Australian dollars per share. Fosters bought the 18.8% stake from Reline Investments, the family investment firm for the Oatleys, who founded the Rosemount Estates label and sold it to Southcorp in 2001. Robert Oatley and his son Sandy Oatley have both resigned from Southcorp's board following the share deal. It seized the top spot when it bought Australian firm BRL Hardy for just over $1bn in 2003.
