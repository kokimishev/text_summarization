The plan is likely to give creditors of Parmalat Finanziaria shares worth about 5.7% of the debts they are owed. Creditors of Parmalat, the main operating company, are likely to see the percentage of debt they receive fall from 7.3% to 6.9%. As part of the re-listing on the Italian stock exchange, creditors' debts are expected to be converted into shares through two new share issues amounting to more than 2bn euros. This is lower than the 11.3% creditors previously hoped to receive. The firm gained protection from creditors in 2003 after revealing debts of 14bn euros ($18.34bn; Â£9.6bn).
