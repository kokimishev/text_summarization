The Commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave "protected designation of origin" status to feta cheese made in Greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there. The German and Danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. Feta cheese battle reaches courtA row over whether only Greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the European Court of Justice. It is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in Denmark such as brie. But critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside Greece. Denmark is Europe's second largest producer of feta after Greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to Greece. The Commission's decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to Italian Parma ham and French Champagne.
