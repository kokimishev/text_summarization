Karachi stocks hit historic highThe Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) has recorded its largest single day gain, surging 3.5% to a new high. "Whenever the market reflects Pakistan's true economic reality, it is described as a bubble." Pakistani investors are expecting the KSE to repeat, if not improve on, its 2002 performance. "Coupled with the 7% GDP growth expected by June this year, I am least surprised at the market's performance," says Mr Lakhani. The index rose 225.79 points in four hours of furious trading, with many investors optimistic that political stability could bring an economic boom. Energy and telecommunication stocks performed particularly well, recording an 8%-10% rise since Monday morning. Analysts argue that a steady improvement in Pakistan's credit ratings by international credit rating agencies has finally begun to register in the market. Pakistanis are now hoping that energy and telecoms, two of the strongest sectors in Pakistan, draw some of the Arab money to the KSE.
