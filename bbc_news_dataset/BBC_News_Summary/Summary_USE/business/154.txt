After the ONS announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about £400m. In January the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Mr Brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's Budget. Economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the Budget. It also said the government might narrowly miss its "golden rule" if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. "None of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years," said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. The changes by the ONS increase the current budget measure for the past five years by £2.1bn in total.
