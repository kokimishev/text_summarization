Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. More broadly, the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact. A series of recent shocks, the Colorado centre has argued, have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets.
