As part of the deal, Federated - owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's - will assume $6bn of May's debt, bringing the deal's total value to $17bn. The deal will bring together famous stores like Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Marshall Field's, creating the largest department store chain in the US. The combined firm will operate about 1,000 stores across the US, with combined annual sales of $30bn. Federated expects the merger to boost earnings from 2007 but the deal will cost it $1bn in one-off charges. Directors at both companies have approved the deal and it is expected to conclude by the third quarter of this year.
