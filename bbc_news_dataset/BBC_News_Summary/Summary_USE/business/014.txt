The Telegraph has announced no plans to go tabloid although both The Independent and The Times have seen circulation rise since shrinking in size. In recent months News Corp's News International unit, which publishes The Sun and the News of the World, the Guardian Media Group, Trinity Mirror and the Daily Mail & General Trust have all announced substantial investments in new printing plants. Telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobsThe Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff. Some broadsheet newspapers - especially those which have not moved to a tabloid format - have suffered circulation declines, which are hitting revenues. Pearson's Financial Times said last week it was offering voluntary redundancy to about 30 reporters. The Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an Â£150m investment in new printing facilities. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists.
