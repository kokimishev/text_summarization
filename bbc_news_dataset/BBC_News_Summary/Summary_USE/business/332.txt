Gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a US court injunction. If found in contempt of the US court order blocking the auction, Gazprom could face having foreign assets seized. Vladimir Putin said it was quite within the rights of a state-owned company to ensure its interests were met. Putin backs state grab for YukosRussia's president has defended the purchase of Yukos' key production unit by state-owned oil firm Rosneft, saying it followed free market principles. Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned. The Russian government put Yukos's Yuganskneftegas subsidiary up for sale last week after hitting the company with a $27bn (Â£14bn) bill for back taxes and fines. Rosneft bought 100% of Baikal Finance Group, in a move that amounts to the renationalisation of a major chunk of Russia's booming oil industry. The latest announcement comes after more than a year of wrangling that has pushed Yukos, one of Russia's biggest companies to the brink of collapse.
