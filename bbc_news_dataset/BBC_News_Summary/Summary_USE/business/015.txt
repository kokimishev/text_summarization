The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. Andy Clarke, ERAA director of air transport, said that the EC advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather. The ERAA's Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. However, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations. Air passengers win new EU rightsAir passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation. Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. Airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to "extraordinary circumstances".
