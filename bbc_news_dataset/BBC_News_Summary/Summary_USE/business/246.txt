Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Ebbers, 63, directed Mr Sullivan to hide the true state of the company's finances by providing false information to the firm's accountants. Giving evidence in the criminal trial of Mr Ebbers, ex-finance chief Scott Sullivan implicated his colleague in the accounting scandal at the firm. However, on Monday Mr Sullivan named Mr Ebbers as one of five executives who participated in the accounting fraud. On his first day of questioning, Mr Sullivan admitted to falsifying the company's financial statements. His lawyers claim that their client was unfamiliar with detailed accounting practices and left that side of the business to Mr Sullivan. Mr Ebbers has denied all the charges, saying he was unaware of the fraud. Mr Sullivan, 42, pleaded guilty to fraud last year and agreed to assist the government with its case against Mr Ebbers.
