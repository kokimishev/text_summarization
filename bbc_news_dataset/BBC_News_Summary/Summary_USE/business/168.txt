The CBI found some firms managed to increase prices for the first time in nine years - but many said increases failed to keep up the rise in costs.

When firms were questioned on output volume, the survey returned a balance of plus 8 - the highest rate of increase for seven years - and rose to plus 11 when looking ahead to the next three months. The CBI also found spending on innovation, training and retraining is forecast to go up over the next year.
