Iranian MPs threaten mobile dealTurkey's biggest private mobile firm could bail out of a $3bn ($1.6bn) deal to build a network in Iran after MPs there slashed its stake in the project. They have already given themselves a veto over all foreign investment deals, following allegations about Turkish firms' involvement in Israel. Telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments, passed earlier in September. Israeli industry minister Ehud Olmert was reported in June to have attended a meeting between Ruhi Dogusoy, Turkcell's chief operating officer, and executives from Israeli telecoms firms. The firm has refused to comment on whether it has business dealings in Israel, although like almost all GSM operators worldwide it has an interconnection deal with Israeli networks so that its customers can use their phones there. But a parliamentary commission has now ruled that Turkcell's 70% controlling stake is too high.
