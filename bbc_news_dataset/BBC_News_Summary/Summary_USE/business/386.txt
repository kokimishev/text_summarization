Krispy Kreme said accounting errors had forced the move, adding that its board of directors made the decision to restate its accounts on 28 December. In a further blow, the firm said it had been advised that some of its franchise owners were not in compliance with their loan agreements, and warned it might need to borrow extra money if it was required to honour agreements on franchisee debts or operating leases. The company warned the move would cut its profits by $3.8m to $4.9m (£2m to £2.6m) - or between 6.6% and 8.6%. Krispy Kreme added that it had enough cash to fund its current operations, but it could not borrow any more under its existing agreements. The revelation comes just a month after the firm warned earnings would be cut by as much as 7.6% as a result of accounting errors. Shareholders have also launched lawsuits against the group, claiming it made false statements and inflated sales.
