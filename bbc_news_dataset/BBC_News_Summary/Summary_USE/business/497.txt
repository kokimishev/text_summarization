Mr Royer was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud, obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Defense lawyers contended that Mr Royer had been feeding information to Mr Elgindy and another trader in an attempt to expose corporate fraud. Mr Elgindy was convicted of racketeering, securities fraud and extortion. "Under the guise of protecting investors from fraud, Royer and Elgindy used the FBI's crime-fighting tools and resources actually to defraud the public," said US Attorney Roslynn Mauskopf. A New York court ruled that former FBI man Jeffrey Royer, 41, fed damaging information to Anthony Elgindy, 36. The Egyptian-born analyst would extort money from his targets in return for stopping the attacks, prosecutors said.
