Markets signal Brazilian recoveryThe Brazilian stock market has risen to a record high as investors display growing confidence in the durability of the country's economic recovery. The market's buoyancy reflects optimism about the Brazilian economy, which could grow by as much as 4.5% in 2004. Economic output declined 0.2% in 2003 and President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva - elected as Brazil's first working-class president in 2002 - was strongly criticised for pursuing a hardline economic policy. President da Silva has defended his policies, arguing that Brazil cannot afford to continue the cycle of boom and bust which afflicted it in recent decades. "For the first time in decades, we have all three economic policy pillars in line during a recovery," Finance Minister Antonio Palocci told the Associated Press news agency. Investors have praised his handling of the economy as foreign investment has risen, unemployment has fallen and inflation has been brought under control.
