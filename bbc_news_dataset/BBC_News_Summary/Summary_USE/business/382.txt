Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted, saying the default age was not a statutory, compulsory retirement age.

The government has announced that firms will be barred from 2006 from imposing arbitrary retirement ages. Ban on forced retirement under 65Employers will no longer be able to force workers to retire before 65, unless they can justify it. The decision will have no impact on the age at which workers can collect their state pension, the government has said. Under age discrimination proposals from the Department of Trade and Industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till 70 if they wished.
