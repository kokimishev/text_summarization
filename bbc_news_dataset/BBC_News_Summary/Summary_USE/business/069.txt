Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. Boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200LR planes over the next 20 years. "Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago" with its product range, said Flight International's Mr Learmount. "Boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful," said David Learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine Flight International. Both Boeing and Airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. It has been producing a rival to Boeing's 777 line for more than a year. Boeing, in contrast to European rival Airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances.
