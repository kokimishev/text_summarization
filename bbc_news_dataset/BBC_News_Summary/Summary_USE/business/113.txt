Vodafone and O2, Britain's other big mobile phone operator, were sent similar statements of objections by the Commission in July last year. The Vodafone spokesman said a similar process would be set in motion with these latest statement of objections about its operations in Germany. The Commission's investigation into Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in Germany. Vodafone sent the Commission a response to those allegations in December last year and is now waiting for a reply. It is the second time Vodafone has come under the Commission's scrutiny. The Commission's latest move comes just a few months after national telecoms regulators across Europe launched a joint investigation which could lead to people being charged less for using their mobile phone when travelling abroad.
