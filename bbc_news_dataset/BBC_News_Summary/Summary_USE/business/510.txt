Lacroix label bought by US firmLuxury goods group LVMH has sold its loss-making Christian Lacroix clothing label to a US investment group. LVMH said the French designer's haute couture and ready-to-wear labels had been purchased by the Falic Group for an unspecified sum. The Falic Group bought two cosmetics labels from LVMH in 2003. The sale of the Lacroix label comes as many fashion houses are struggling to make money from their expensive haute couture ranges.
