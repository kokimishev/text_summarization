"This is an excellent move by American Express to focus on its core businesses, and sell off a laggard division, which has been a problem for quite some time," said Marquis Investment Research analyst Phil Kain. Amex shares up on spin-off newsShares in American Express surged more than 8% on Tuesday after it said it was to spin off its less profitable financial advisory subsidiary. AEFA has more than 12,000 advisers selling financial advice, funds and insurance to 2.5 million customers. The US credit card to travel services giant said off-loading American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) would boost its profitability.
