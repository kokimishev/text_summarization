Several former HealthSouth employees have already pleaded guilty to fraud and are expected to give evidence against Mr Scrushy. Mr Scrushy is the first chief executive to be tried for breaching the Sarbanes Oxley Act - a law introduced in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom frauds which obliges corporate bosses to vouch for the accuracy of their companies' results. Richard Scrushy, 52, is accused of "directing" a $2.7bn (Â£1.4bn) accounting fraud at the company he co-founded in Alabama in 1984. Defence lawyers said Mr Scrushy had been deceived by other executives.
