House prices have risen 0.9% this year, Nationwide said, and if this pace of increase persists, prices would rise by just under 6% in the year to December. The annual rate has halved since August last year, as interest rises have cooled the housing market. And last summer, economists at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) warned house prices were overvalued and could fall by between 10% and 15% by 2009. Further evidence of a slowdown in the housing market emerged from Bank of England lending figures released on Tuesday. There have been a number of warnings that the UK housing market may be heading for a downturn after four years of strong growth to 2004. Nationwide said that in January house prices went up by 0.4% on the month and by 12.6% on a year earlier. Overall, mortgage lending rose by £7.2bn in January, marginally up on the £7.1bn rise in December.
