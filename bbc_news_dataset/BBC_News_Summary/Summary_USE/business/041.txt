Meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. While the US economy is growing at a "reasonably good pace" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US. Since President George W Bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year. He called on Congress to cut promised benefits for retirees, as the promised benefits for the soon-to-retire baby boom generation were much larger than the government could afford. Speaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit.
