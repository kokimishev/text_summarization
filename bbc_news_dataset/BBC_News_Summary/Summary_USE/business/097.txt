Higher growth in Europe is regarded by US officials as a way the huge US current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. Policy makers in Europe have called the dollar's slide "brutal" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. But analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant. "The eurozone is growing below its potential. A weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. Economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the US economy are looking far from rosy. US officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the US is not the main global growth engine.
