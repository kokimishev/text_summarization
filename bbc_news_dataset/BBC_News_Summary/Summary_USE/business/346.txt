Insured damage could be a fraction of the "billions of dollars worth of destruction in Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Indonesia, the Maldive Islands and Malaysia," said Prudential Equity Group insurance analyst Jay Gelb. Many of the affected countries, such as Indonesia, Sri Lanka or the Maldives, do not usually buy insurance for these kinds of disasters, said a US-based insurance expert. But insurers have not had long to assess the economic impact of the damage and reports of more casualties and destruction are still coming through. Zurich Financial said they could not yet assess the cost of the disaster. A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. The company has paid out about 300 million euros (£281m; $400m) to cover damage caused recently by four major hurricanes in the US. Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, said that its exposure is less than 100m euros (£70m; $136m). "US insurers are likely to have only minimal to no exposure. Rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said.
