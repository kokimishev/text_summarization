The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant. "Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next," said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website. China suspends 26 power projectsChina has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian.
