The tax is designed to provide much-needed revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped economy. Cuba winds back economic clockFidel Castro's decision to ban all cash transactions in US dollars in Cuba has once more turned the spotlight on Cuba's ailing economy. Critics of the measure argue that it is a step backwards, reflecting the Cuban president's desire to increase his control of the economy and to clamp down on private enterprise. Cuban citizens, who receive money from overseas, and foreign visitors, who change dollars in Cuba, will be affected. Those remaining in Cuba will have to pay the tax. A leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castro's tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture. The tax will also affect the two million tourists who visit Cuba every year, particularly those Americans who continue to defy a ban on travel there. The tax will hit the families of Cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home.
