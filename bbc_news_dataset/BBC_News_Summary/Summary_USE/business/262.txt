Shares in Munich Re and Swiss Re - the world's two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in Asia. Currencies including the Thai baht and Indonesian rupiah weakened as analysts warned that economic growth may slow. However, the overall impact on Asia's largest stock market, Japan's Nikkei, was slight. The unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares, however. Worries about the size of insurance liabilities dragged European shares down, although the impact was exacerbated by light post-Christmas trading. The Indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the US dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300. Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa also suffered a decline in value. Malaysia's budget airline, AirAsia fell 2.9%. But the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the US and Asia.
