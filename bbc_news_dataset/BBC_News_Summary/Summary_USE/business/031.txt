Irish markets reach all-time highIrish shares have risen to a record high, with investors persuaded to buy into the market by low inflation and strong growth forecasts. Several of Ireland's biggest companies saw their market value hit recent highs on Thursday. "Buoyant economic conditions are set to continue in Ireland over the next few years and Irish equities continue to offer quality growth at a reasonable valuation." Analysts said that economic conditions were benign and Irish shares were still trading at a discount to other European markets. A fall in the rate of inflation to 2.3% in January gave a fresh boost to shares which have advanced 4% this month. Ireland's economic 'miracle' is enjoying a second wind, with 5% growth forecast for 2005 and 2006.
