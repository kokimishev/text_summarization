Pension hitch for long-living menMale life expectancy is much higher than originally estimated, leading pension researchers have said. "Even people in social class V [unskilled manual workers] who are widely likely to have the lowest life expectancy can still expect to live 16 years after state pension age," he said. The Pensions Policy Institute (PPI) said life expectancy for unskilled and professional men has been understated. The government has ruled out raising the state pension age, because it says it would penalise lower-skilled workers who generally have lower life expectancies.
