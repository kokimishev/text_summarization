In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. But Germany needs much more reform if all its industry is to compete with places such Hungary or China. With Germany making up a third of the eurozone's economy, this is a major problem. "Labour is too costly in Germany, especially for the low skilled labour and this is the main problem. Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home. The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University. It is not just globalisation that is hurting; the law in France means workers are paid for a 39 hour week even though they work just 35 hours. If Germany does not once again become the powerhouse of Europe, growth across the bloc is never going to be as strong as it could be. Like northern England and industrial Scotland, those industries have been in long term decline - the last coal pit closed in 1990.
