However, total output across the Euro zone is forecast to fall in 2004 from 1.9% to 1.8%. "In view of the fragility of factors of domestic growth and the dampening effects of the stronger euro on domestic economic activity and inflation, monetary policy in the euro area is likely to continue to 'wait and see', the organisation said in its report. The eight central European states which joined the EU last year will see 4.6% growth, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said. On Monday, Germany's BdB private banks association said the German economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005. UNECE is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the European Union in 2005. In contrast, the 12 Euro zone countries will put in a "lacklustre" performance, generating growth of only 1.8%.
