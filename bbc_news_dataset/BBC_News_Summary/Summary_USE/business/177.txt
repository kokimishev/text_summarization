Last week, figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) indicated that the popularity of buy-to-let mortgages - a key phenomenon of the housing boom - could be waning. Overall, B&B said that "housing market fundamentals remain strong". Recent housing market surveys have indicated that the UK property market has cooled in recent months after several years of rapid growth. But B&B - which has a 22% share of the UK buy-to-let mortgage market - said that while rates of growth were moderating, the sector "continues to grow at a rate considerably above that of the whole mortgage market". Wimpey reported a 19% rise in profits to Â£450.7m and said recent new home reservations were better than expected. Wimpey said the UK housing market had proved "challenging" last year.
