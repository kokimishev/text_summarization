Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. And its owner, P&O Cruises - now part of the huge US Carnival Corporation - was looking at a significant slice chopped off this year's profits and a potential PR fiasco. Other investors barely blinked, and by 1300 GMT Carnival's shares in London were down a single penny, or 0.03%, at Â£32.26. Assuming that Citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in Carnival's favour. "Moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises." That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, Royal Caribbean. And with Carnival remaining the market leader, it looks set to keep selling the tickets - no matter what happens to the ill-fated Aurora in the future.
