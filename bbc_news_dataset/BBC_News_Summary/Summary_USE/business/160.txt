Fiat had sold GM a stake in 2000, as part of a partnership agreement. Instead, GM swapped a 6% stake in itself for 20% of Fiat - and gave Fiat a "put option" to sell GM the rest of the car maker between January 2004 and July 2009. Analysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving GM's stake to 10%. But Fiat's heavy losses have convinced GM - whose own European operations are in the red - to back away. But despite the alliance Fiat failed to put itself back on track, continuing to lose money and market share.
