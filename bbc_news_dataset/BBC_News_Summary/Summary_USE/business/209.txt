David Cummings, head of UK equities for Standard Life Investments, said he believed a "well funded" 300p a share bid would be enough for Mr Glazer to take control of the club. Mr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. The board of Man Utd is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal from the US tycoon that values the club at £800m ($1.5bn). The US tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the United board with "detailed proposals", it has confirmed. A spokesman for the supporters club said: "I cannot see any difference (compared to Mr Glazer's previous proposals) other than £200m less debt. But the Man Utd supporters club urged the club to reject the new deal. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid.
