Georgia plans hidden asset pardonGeorgia is offering a one-off 'tax amnesty' to people who hid their earnings under the regime of former president Eduard Shevardnadze. The new government is encouraging companies to pay taxes by scrapping existing corruption investigations and destroying all tax records from before 1 January, three days before President Saakashvili was elected. The country's new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, has said that anyone now willing to disclose their wealth will only have to pay 1% in income tax. By declaring their assets and paying the one-off tax, people would be able to "legalise their property", Mr Saakashvili stressed. Mr Saakashvili has accused the Shevardnadze regime, which was toppled by a popular uprising in November, of allowing bribery to flourish. The measure is designed to legitimise previously hidden economic activity and boost Georgia's flagging economy.
