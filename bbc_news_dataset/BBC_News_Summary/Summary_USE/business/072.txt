The country's economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers' credit card spending spree. Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. It had cut rates in November to help revive the economy, but rising inflation - reaching 0.7% month-on-month in January - has stopped it from cutting further. Credit card debt is falling, with only one in 13 of the 48 million cards now in default - down from one in eight at the end of 2003. Card use fell sharply last year, but is now picking up again with a rise in spending of 14.8% year-on-year. Exports - traditionally the driver for expansion in Asian economies - grew slower in January than at any time in 17 months.
