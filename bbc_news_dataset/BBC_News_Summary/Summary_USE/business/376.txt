Dollar slides ahead of New YearThe US dollar has hit a new record low against the euro and analysts predict that more declines are likely in 2005. Earlier on Thursday, the Japanese yen touched its lowest versus the euro on concerns about economic growth in Asia. The dollar slid to a record $1.3666 versus the euro on Thursday, before bouncing back to $1.3636. Disappointing economic reports dented the currency, which had been rallying after European policy makers said they were worried about the euro's strength. The yen, meanwhile, dropped to 141.60 per euro in afternoon trading. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances.
