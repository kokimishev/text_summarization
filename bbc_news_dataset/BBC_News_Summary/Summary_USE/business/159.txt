Presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament, Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in. As part of his reforms he has announced:- Duty cuts on capital goods and raw materials  - Expanded service tax net  - Raised the income-tax threshold to 100,000 rupees ($2,300)  - Reduced income tax for those earning less than 250,000 rupees ($5,700) to 20%  - Reduced corporate tax rates to 30%An annual economic survey released on Friday said India needed to ease limit restriction on foreign investment, reform labour laws and cut duties apart from widening the tax base for long-term economic growth. But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%, Mr Chidambaram said - falling short of the new law's requirement. The priority for Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram is to fight poverty and keep the government's Communist allies onside. The finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming India's tax system while expanding the tax base. In his budget Mr Chidambaram has:- Increased spending on primary education to 71.56bn rupees ($1.6bn)  - Increased spending on health to 102.8bn rupees ($2.35bn)  - Announced that 80bn rupees ($1.8bn) will be spent on building rural infrastructure  - Pledged 102.16bn rupees ($2.3bn) for tsunami victims  - Increased flow of funds to agriculture by 30%  - Announced a package for the sugar industryIn addition, up to 100bn rupees ($2.3bn) to be spent on infrastructure will be sourced by borrowing against the country's foreign exchange reserves, keeping budgeted spending under control. Under the fiscal responsibility law, Mr Chidambaram has to trim the deficit by 0.3 percentage points each year, a target he says he has now met for the current year.
