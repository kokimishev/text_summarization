China already has more than enough cigarette-making capacity, according to a spokesman for the tobacco industry regulator quoted in China Daily. "China will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built, including joint ventures", said Xing Wangli, a spokesman for the State Tobacco Administration Monopoly quoted in China Daily. "Xing's statement comes as especially bad news for British American Tobacco", the China Daily newspaper said of the latest development. The ban threatens to reignite tensions between the regulator and British American Tobacco, which plans to become China's first foreign cigarette maker. China bans new tobacco factoriesThe world's biggest tobacco consumer, China, has said it will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built. The decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before 2005, according to the French news agency AFP. China's tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the West.
