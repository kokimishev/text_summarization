China continues rapid growthChina's economy has expanded by a breakneck 9.5% during 2004, faster than predicted and well above 2003's 9.1%. Growth in industrial output - the main target of government efforts to impose curbs on credit and investments - was 11.5% in 2004, down from 17% the previous year. Despite the apparent rebalancing of the economy the overall growth picture remains strong, economists said. China raised rates by 0.27 percentage points to 5.8% - its first hike in nine years - in October 2004. The news may mean more limits on investment and lending as Beijing tries to take the economy off the boil. Still, consumer prices - at 2.4% - rose faster than in 2004, adding to concern that a sharp rise in producer prices of 7.1% could stoke inflation.
