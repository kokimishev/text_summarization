 Italy to get economic action planItalian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on Thursday night in Rome. Mr Berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (R&D) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. The prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 GMT. Analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. The government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of Italy's 60 million population. He has also promised to cap spending on transport, education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. Critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make Italy's problems worse. Limiting government spending will lead to job losses, they counter, while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy. The country has been one of the eurozone's worst economic performers in recent years. Without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing Italy's economy to a juddering halt. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of Italy's economy.
