 Gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. It may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example. The government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new Child Trust Fund. All children born after 1st September 2002 will be eligible. Interest earned by children is subject to income tax. However, children, like adults, have a personal income tax allowance (£4,745 for the current tax year). As long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance, then no tax will be payable. The tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. Only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. Another favourite solution is Premium Bonds. With the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. Any prizes will be sent to the parent or child's guardian. There are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored. Exchange Traded Funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market.
