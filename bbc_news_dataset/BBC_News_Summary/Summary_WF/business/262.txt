 "The impact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating, especially in Thailand." Travel-related shares dropped in Europe, with companies such as Germany's TUI and Lufthansa and France's Club Mediterranne sliding. Insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in Europe. Zurich Financial, Allianz and Axa also suffered a decline in value. The unfolding scale of the disaster in south Asia had little immediate impact on US shares, however. Thai Airways shed almost 4%. Singapore Airlines dropped 2.6%. Malaysia's budget airline, AirAsia fell 2.9%. Resort operator Tanco Holdings slumped 5%. Travel companies also took a hit, with Japan's Kinki Nippon sliding 1.5% and HIS dropping 3.3%. However, the overall impact on Asia's largest stock market, Japan's Nikkei, was slight. Shares fell just 0.03%. The Thai baht lost 0.3% against the US currency, trading at 39.10.
