 Fresh hope after Argentine crisisThree years after Argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis, there is fresh hope. True, problems remain, but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. Even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) admits this. The debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which, at least initially, was made worse by the government's decisions. Argentina was on the brink of collapse. The subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people's life savings disappear. Scathes of companies went bust. "Three years ago, every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis," said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine. It really was dire. "Agriculture and tourism are helping," said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine. He explained that initially, his firm is going to export building materials to Spain and United States. Then, he would like to diversify to other areas, depending on the market. But not all that shines is gold. Argentina's current offer implies that the creditors would get just 25 cents for each dollar they are owed, according to the creditors. Understandably, they want more and until they do, both they and others are loath to continue lending. For President Kirchner, this proves a hopeless challenge. "A lot of them invested in good faith," he said. Mr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, agreed.
