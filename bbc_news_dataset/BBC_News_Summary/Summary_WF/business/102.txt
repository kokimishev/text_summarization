 The Titan corporation was accused of funnelling more than $2m into the 2001 re-election campaign of President Mathieu Kerekou. At the time, Titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in Benin. Titan, a California-based company, pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating US anti-bribery laws. The SEC had accused Titan of illegally paying $2.1m to an unnamed agent in Benin claiming ties with President Kerekou. Shortly after the poll, which Mr Kerekou won, Benin officials agreed to quadruple Titan's management fee. The company says it no longer tolerates such practices. Under the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, it is a crime for American firms to bribe foreign officials.
