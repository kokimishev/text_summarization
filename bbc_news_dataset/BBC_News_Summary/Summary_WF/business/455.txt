 Qantas considers offshore optionAustralian airline Qantas could transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs, according to newspaper reports. Unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying Qantas was profitable. Early this year, Qantas increased the number of flight attendants based in London from 370 to 870. If Qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff 'offshore' 7,000 jobs could shift overseas, the newspaper reported. In a statement, Qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas. "We are totally committed to continuing to grow jobs in Australia," Mr Dixon said. Unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure, arguing that Qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action.
