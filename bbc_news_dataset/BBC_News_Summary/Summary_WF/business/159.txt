 India's defence budget has also been raised 7.8% to 830bn rupees ($19bn). But the heavy spending on poverty reduction means the 2005-6 target for the deficit will be 4.3%, Mr Chidambaram said - falling short of the new law's requirement. The following year, though, would have to be back on track, he warned. Presenting his budget in the lower house of parliament, Mr Chidambaram said the Indian economy was performing strongly and that inflation has been reined in. He said India's economy grew 6.9% in 2004. "Given the resilience of the Indian economy... it is possible to launch a direct assault on poverty," Mr Chidambaram said. The finance minister says he is committed to continue reforming India's tax system while expanding the tax base. But Mr Chidambaram is under pressure from the Communist parties to focus on increasing social spending. In recent months, they have expressed their displeasure at the government's economic reform plans including increasing foreign direct investment in telecommunication and aviation.
