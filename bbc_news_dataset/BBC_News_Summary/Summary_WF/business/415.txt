 The average house price fell marginally to £180,226, from £180,444 in October. Economists, however, forecast that ODPM figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months. The Halifax, meanwhile, said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in December - the first monthly rise since September. All areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in November except for Northern Ireland and the West Midlands, where the rate was unchanged, the ODPM said.
