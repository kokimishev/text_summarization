 The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares. Gazprom chief Alexei Miller confirmed Rosneft-owned Yugansk was not part of the deal and will instead be spun off. Under the agreement, the state will get a controlling share of Gazprom in exchange for Rosneft. The state wanted to control Gazprom before allowing foreigners to trade. By opening up trading in Gazprom to foreigners, the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders. Currently, foreigners can only trade in Gazprom via a small issue of London-listed proxy shares. "The majority of investors are going to be happy," he added. However, analysts were disappointed that Yugansk would not be included in the deal. "Ultimately and industrially, Gazprom needs Yugansk," he added. Instead, the merged Gazprom-Rosneft group will rank alongside Sibneft with 7% of the market. The shell company was then snapped up by Rosneft.
