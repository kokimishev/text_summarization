 Air passengers win new EU rightsAir passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation. The new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. Previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding. The EU decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. When this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation. However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to "extraordinary circumstances". Low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. The European Regions Airline Association (ERAA) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. In cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. The ERAA's Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers.
