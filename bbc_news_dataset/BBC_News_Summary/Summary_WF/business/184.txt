 Stuart Rose, head of M&S, said last year its prices were too high. "We are bringing in ranges at new price points to compete against mid-market retailers like Next," said M&S. Next is one of M&S's biggest competitors and the move may force it to lower prices. "Either way, this cannot be good news for M&S' margin," it added. A sudden spike in M&S's share price followed. However, an M&S spokesman said on Sunday it had no evidence that Mr Paulsmeier had lined up sufficient finance for a bid.
