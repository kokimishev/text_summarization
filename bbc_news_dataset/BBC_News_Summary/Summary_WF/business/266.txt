 But in the looking-glass world of modern Russia, the opposite might just be true, a new report* has argued. But it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all Russian firms, even targets of the tax police. The calculations demonstrated what many Russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. In the West, meanwhile, higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. The report highlights the case of Sibneft, a Russian oil company that came close to merging with Yukos last year. In part, certainly. For all its faults, corporate Russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. For a start, the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit, governments want to maximise tax revenue. Companies can, for example, persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes. And the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically Western.
