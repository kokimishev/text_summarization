 Earlier this month, Mr Glazer presented the board with detailed proposals on an offer to buy the football club. But it said it continued to oppose Mr Glazer's plans, calling his assumptions "aggressive" and his plan "damaging". Many of Manchester United's supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer. Manchester United's response comes as little surprise, as the board made clear. "Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal," the club said in its statement. But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer's proposal. At present, Mr Glazer and his family hold a 28.1% stake, making them Manchester United's second biggest shareholders. If the family makes a formal offer, they will need the support of the club's biggest shareholders. However, the DTI has dismissed the proposal. Mr Glazer's offer values the club at Â£800m ($1.5bn). Manchester United shares closed at 270.25p on Friday, down 3.75p on the day.
