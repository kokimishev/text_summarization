 US Ahold suppliers face chargesUS prosecutors have charged nine food suppliers with helping Dutch retailer Ahold inflate earnings by more than $800m (Â£428m). The charges have been brought against individuals as well as companies, alleging they created false accounts. Three former Ahold top executives last year agreed to settle fraud charges. Ahold has admitted that it fraudulently inflated promotional allowances at Foodservice, improperly consolidated joint ventures and also committed other accounting errors and irregularities. Food companies pay supermarkets and retailers for prime shelf space. At the time of the scandal, Ahold was seen by many as Europe's Enron. Ahold is the world's fourth-largest supermarket chain. Its other US businesses include Stop & Shop, and Giant Food.
