 But the Lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. Mr Kok was commissioned by the European Commission in March this year to assess how far the EU has come towards meeting the Lisbon targets, five years on from their inception. Lisbon risks becoming a "synonym for missed objectives and failed promises", his report said. The report comes at a time when Europe's competitive position is waning. The EU's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. While there has been growth in overall employment rates in Europe, productivity lags behind that of the US. But meeting the Lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no EU member state has volunteered so far. You find trade unions fighting change. But also the employers' associations. The agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised. "Lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing," the Kok report said. That's why the Kok report recommends that the Lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. On one point Mr Kok was very clear: The European Union should not try to emulate the US economy. In that sense, the Lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. "It's very ambitious," said John Palmer, political director at the European Policy Centre, a Brussels-based think-tank. It's going to require quite new and innovative policies." Mr Barroso has said that the EU's competitiveness will be his top priority.
