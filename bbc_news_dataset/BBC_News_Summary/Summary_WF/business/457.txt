 Writing in the Financial Times, Mr Schroeder also said heads of government should have a greater say in reforms. The current EU rules limit the size of a eurozone country's deficit to 3% of GDP. Deficits should be allowed to rise above 3%, Mr Schroeder argued, if countries meet several "mandatory criteria". Mr Schroeder's intervention comes ahead of a meeting of the 12 Eurozone finance ministers on Monday to discuss the pact. A number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone's rules.
