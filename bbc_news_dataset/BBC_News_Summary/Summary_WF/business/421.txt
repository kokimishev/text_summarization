 A Â£1.3bn offer from Deutsche Boerse has already been rejected, while Euronext has said it will make an all cash bid. However, the Sunday Telegraph report added that there are signs that Deutsche Boerse chief executive Werner Seifert is becoming increasingly impatient with the LSE's managed bid process. Meanwhile, the German exchange's offer has come under fire recently. A further stumbling block is Deutsche Boerse's control over its Clearstream unit, the clearing house that processes securities transactions.
