 WMC said it made net profits of 1.33bn Australian dollars ($1bn; Â£550m) in 2004, up from A$246bn the year before. Now reports say that the Australian government is against the deal. Trade Minister Mark Vaile has said that the bid may be "against the national interest". The bid was thrown out by Treasurer Peter Costello on national interest grounds. WMC's interests in uranium deposits were a contributing factor, Mr Vaile said. Its stellar performance in 2004 has been built on sky-high prices for metals. Nickel prices rose 43% during the year, with copper up 36%.
