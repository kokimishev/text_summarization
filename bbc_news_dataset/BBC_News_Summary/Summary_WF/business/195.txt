 The rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects. According to NIESR, if the government's current economic cycle runs until March 2006 then it is "unlikely" the golden rule will be met. Should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to "50/50". Either way, fiscal tightening is needed, NIESR said. Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic. Other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the NIESR report was optimistic about the state of the UK and global economy. Hinting at better times for UK exporters, NIESR said the euro zone "is expected to pick up speed". Growth in Britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR said, was the UK's much analysed and fretted over property market.
