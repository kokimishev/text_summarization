 The new President, Viktor Yushchenko, has said a "limited" list of companies is being drawn up. But on Wednesday Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said the government was planning to renationalise 3,000 firms. Ms Tymoshenko said prosecutors had drawn up a list of more than 3,000 businesses which were to be reviewed. A day earlier, Mr Yushchenko - keen to reassure potential investors - had said only 30 to 40 top firms would be targeted. An open-ended list could further damage outside investors' fragile faith in Ukraine, said Stuart Hensel of the Economist Intelligence Unit. As a result, it was planning to resell rather than keep firms in state hands. Foreign investment in Ukraine, at about $40 a head in 2004, is one of the lowest among ex-Soviet states. His opponent, Viktor Yanukovich, still has huge support in the country's eastern industrial heartland. Mr Yushchenko's administration has accused its predecessor, led by ex-President Leonid Kuchma, of corruption. The mill, Krivorizhstal, is one of the world's most profitable. One of the jilted bidders, Netherlands-based group LNM, said it welcomed the possibility that the mill might be back on the market. A resale of Krivorizhstal could potentially triple the price, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit has / it is Mr Hensel.
