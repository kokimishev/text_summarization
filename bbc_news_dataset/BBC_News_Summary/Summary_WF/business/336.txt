 An employment tribunal dismissed Stephanie Villalba's allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay. Ms Villalba, the former head of Merrill's private client business in Europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal. Merrill Lynch denied Ms Villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. The firm had told the tribunal that Ms Villalba's division had been losing about $1m a week. Merrill said Ms Villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.
