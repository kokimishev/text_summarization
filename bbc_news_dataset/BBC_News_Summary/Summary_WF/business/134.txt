 US adds more jobs than expectedThe US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations. In a welcome economic boost for newly re-elected President George W Bush, the Labor Department figures come after a slow summer of weak jobs gains. Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing. The 337,000 new jobs added to US payrolls in October was twice the 169,000 figure that Wall Street economists had forecast.
