 No-one, however, seems to have told the stock markets. "The Aurora issue had been an ongoing one for some time," says Deutsche Bank's Simon Champion. And generally speaking, Carnival has a reputation for keeping its ships pretty much on schedule. "Carnival has an incredibly strong track record," Mr Champion. Similarly, analysts expect the impact on the rest of the cruise business to be limited. That should mitigate some of the PR risk, both for Carnival and its main competitor, Royal Caribbean. "Moreover, such events typically have a limited impact on bookings and pricing for future cruises." Assuming that Citigroup is right, and demand stays solid, the structure of the industry also works in Carnival's favour. In the wake of P&O Princess's takeover by Carnival, the business is now to a great extent a duopoly. In other words, if you do want a cruise, your options are limited.
