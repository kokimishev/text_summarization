 A barrel of US crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in New York on Tuesday. Brent crude also rose in London trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close. "If the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher." Several Opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. "I do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel," he added. Heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases.
