 Vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but Merck said it would consider selling it if it gets FDA approval. The Cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including Merck and Pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers. Merck's announcement of a possible reintroduction of Vioxx caught analysts by surprise. European regulators, meanwhile, ruled on Thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take Cox-2 inhibitors.
