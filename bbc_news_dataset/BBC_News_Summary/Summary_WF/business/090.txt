 Wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough. A further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of French producers, in low interest loans. The aid package would "create a positive climate around French viticulture," Mr Bussereau said. However, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. The government will also seek European Union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation. Production is currently outstripping demand by about 30%.
