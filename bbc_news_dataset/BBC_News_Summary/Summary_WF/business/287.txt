 Mr Toshitsune is one of Japan's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. And when it comes to longevity, Japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that. Women can expect to live until 85, men until 78, four years longer than Americans and Europeans. "I think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved," he remarks. "On average, we can live longer." But while life may be a game of golf for Mr Shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. Japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US. But unfortunately, Japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. One option is further welfare reform. Another is immigration, possibly from the Philippines and Indonesia. But so far, any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff. But, as yet, Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island. In Japan, as in Europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject. Of course the Japanese could always have more children. Come 2020, Japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. But none of this is Mr Toshitsune's concern anymore. At 101, he chuckles that, he feels fine.
