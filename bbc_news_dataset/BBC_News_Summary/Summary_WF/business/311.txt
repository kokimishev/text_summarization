 The world's second biggest insurer said disasters around the globe have seen property claims reach $42bn (Â£21.5bn). "2004 reinforces the trend towards higher losses," said Swiss Re. Some 95% of insurance claims were for natural catastrophes, with the rest attributed to made-made events. The damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years, including 2001 when the 11 September attacks pushed claims up to $37bn. Swiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters around the world in 2004.
