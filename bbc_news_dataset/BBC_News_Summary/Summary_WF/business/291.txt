 Tobacco stocks rose sharply on Wall Street after the 2-1 decision. Anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the Justice Department has not said if it will appeal. Among the accused were Altria Group, RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Liggett Group and Brown and Williamson. Charles A Blixt, executive vice-president of RJ Reynolds Tobacco, said the ruling "dramatically transforms" the government's lawsuit. The Justice Department refused to say if it would appeal. But William Corr of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids urged the government to continue pressing its case.
