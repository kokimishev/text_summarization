 Iran's parliament voted by a large majority to cut Turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%. Turkcell said the decision "increases the risks" attached to the project. Although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal. The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal. Turkcell's mobile deal is the second Turkish investment in Iran to run into trouble. The hardline posture taken by parliament, which is dominated by religious conservatives, could yet impact other inward investments.
