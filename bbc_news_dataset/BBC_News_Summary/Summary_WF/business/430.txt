 US prepares for hybrid onslaughtSales of hybrid cars in the US are set to double in 2005, research suggests. Research group JD Power estimates sales will hit 200,000 in 2005, despite higher prices and customer scepticism. Carmakers are starting to build hybrid sports utility vehicles (SUVs), the four-wheel-drive vehicles which now dominate the US car market. Several jurisdictions, notably the state of California, mandate low emissions for new cars. At the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. Honda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. GM has a hybrid pickup on the market and is showing two concept SUVs in Detroit. Even sports car maker Porsche may join the race, although it insists it is still considering whether to hybridise its Cayenne SUV. Others remain more sceptical. Nissan has bought Toyota's hybrid technology, but plans to bring out its first model only in 2006. "We want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology," Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said. Volkswagen, meanwhile, says it will focus on clean-burning diesel engines instead.
