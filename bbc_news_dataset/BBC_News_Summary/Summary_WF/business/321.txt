 Although Diageo's best-known brands include Smirnoff vodka and Guinness stout, it already has a US winemaking arm - Diageo Chateau & Estate Wines. It said Chalone would be integrated into its existing US wine business. "The US wine market represents a growth opportunity for Diageo, with favourable demographic and consumption trends," said Diageo North America president Ivan Menezes. In the year ending 31 December 2003, Chalone reported revenues of $69.4m.
