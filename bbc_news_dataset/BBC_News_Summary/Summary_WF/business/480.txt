 Wipro beats forecasts once againWipro, India's third-biggest software firm, has reported a 60% rise in profit, topping market expectations. Profit had been forecast to be 4.1bn rupees. Wipro said demand was strong, allowing it to increase the prices it charged. Third-quarter sales rose 34% to 20.9bn rupees. One problem identified by Wipro was the high turnover of its staff. "We have to get that under control," said vice-chairman Vivek Paul. Wipro is majority owned by India's richest man Azim Premji.
