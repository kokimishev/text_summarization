 High fuel prices hit BA's profitsBritish Airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits. Rod Eddington, BA's chief executive, said the results were "respectable" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by £106m or 47.3%. BA's profits were still better than market expectation of £59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues. To help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, BA last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers. Turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to £1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. However, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. BA had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue. It also reported on Friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in January. Since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the United States, BA has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive. BA's shares closed up four pence at 274.5 pence.
