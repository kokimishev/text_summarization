 Thailand's economy is now expected to grow by 5.7% in 2005, rather than 6% as forecast before tsunamis hit six tourist provinces. The full economic costs of the disaster remain unclear. But Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs on Wednesday, suggesting that investors do not fear a major economic impact. India's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. In the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. "Our nation is in peril here," said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. "It will not be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP," he said. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes."
