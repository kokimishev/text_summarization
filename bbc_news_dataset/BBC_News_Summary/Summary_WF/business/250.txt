 Profits stall at China's LenovoProfits at Chinese computer firm Lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition. Lenovo's profit for the three months to December was HK$327m (US$42m; Â£22m), less than 1% up on the year before. But Western firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in China, and Lenovo's sales were down 3.7% by revenue to HK$6.31bn. If the $1.75bn agreement Lenovo signed with IBM on 8 December goes through, it will mark the end of an era. IBM pioneered the desktop PC market in the early 1980s, although strategic mis-steps helped lose it its early dominance. But investors have been less than impressed with Lenovo's move, designed to take it out of China and further onto the world stage. Its shares are down 20% since the announcement two months ago, largely because of the unprofitability of the unit it is buying.
