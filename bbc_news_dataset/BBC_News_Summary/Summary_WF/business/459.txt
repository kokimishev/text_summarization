 'Golden economic period' to endTen years of "golden" economic performance may come to an end in 2005 with growth slowing markedly, City consultancy Deloitte has warned. Deloitte is forecasting economic growth of 2% this year, below Chancellor Gordon Brown's forecast of 3% to 3.5%. Economic growth is likely to be constrained during the next few years by increased pressure on household budgets and rising taxes, Deloitte believes. This will result in a marked slowdown in growth in 2005 and 2006 compared to last year, when the economy expanded by 3.25%.
