 Saudi ministry to employ womenWomen will be employed in Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry for the first time this year, Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal has been reported as saying. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de-facto ruler, told government departments to put plans in place for employing women. But progress has been slow, reports from the country say. The newspaper said many Saudi women found his explanation "a pitiful excuse for not employing women".
