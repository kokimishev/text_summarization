 Venezuela and China sign oil dealVenezuelan president Hugo Chavez has offered China wide-ranging access to the country's oil reserves. Venezuela has also offered to supply 120,000 barrels of fuel oil a month to China. China's quick-growing economy's need for oil has contributed to record-high oil prices this year, along with political unrest in the Middle East and supply bottlenecks. Oil prices are finishing the year roughly 30% higher than they were in January 2004. Mr Chavez, who is visiting China, said his country would put its many of its oil facilities at the disposal of China.
