 Asia quake increases poverty riskNearly two million people across Asia could be thrown into poverty because of the Indian Ocean tsunami, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has said. "Poverty is potentially the most important impact of this natural disaster," said ADB chief economist Ifzal Ali. A quarter of a million Sri Lankans and 23,500 people in the Maldives are also facing poverty. Sri Lanka's government has estimated reconstruction costs at nearly $3bn. Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and India have enjoyed strong economic growth in recent years, which should cushion them against reconstruction costs. But the economies of the affected countries except Sri Lanka and the Maldives should emerge with minimal damage," the ADB report said. Some businesses may even gain from the reconstruction efforts, thereby creating jobs. Debt repayment holidays carry the risk of credit ratings downgrades, making it more expensive to borrow money in future. Indonesia, however, is pressing for greater help with its debts than the current freeze would bring. It is one of the world's most indebted countries.
