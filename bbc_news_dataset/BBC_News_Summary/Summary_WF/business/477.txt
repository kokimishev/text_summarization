 JP Morgan admits US slavery linksThousands of slaves were accepted as collateral for loans by two banks that later became part of JP Morgan Chase. Citizens Bank and Canal Bank are the two lenders that were identified. They are now closed, but were linked to Bank One, which JP Morgan bought last year. About 13,000 slaves were used as loan collateral between 1831 and 1865. Because of defaults by plantation owners, Citizens and Canal ended up owning about 1,250 slaves. "Slavery was tragically ingrained in American society, but that is no excuse."
