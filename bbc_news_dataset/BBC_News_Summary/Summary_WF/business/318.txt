 Baikal Finance Group emerged as the auction winner, agreeing to pay 260.75bn roubles (Â£4.8bn; $9.4bn). Russia's newspapers claimed that Baikal was a front for gas monopoly Gazprom, which had been expected to win. The sale has destroyed Yukos, once the owner of Yuganskneftegas, said founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. "Yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s. "They screwed up the financing," said Ronald Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. "And Gazprom does not have this sort of money lying around." Gazprom has denied that it is behind the purchase. "We do not know if this company is linked 100% to Gazprom. The sale has however bought time for Gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said. Menatep, Yukos main shareholders' group, has also threatened legal action.
