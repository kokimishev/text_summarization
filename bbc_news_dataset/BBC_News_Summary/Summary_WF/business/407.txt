 Recently, India's first low-cost airline ordered 30 Airbus A320 planes for $1.8bn. Under the agreement, Air Deccan will buy 15 new ATR 72-500 and lease another 15. ATR will also provide six second hand airplanes. Mr Gopinath said the planes will connect regional Indian cities. Air Deccan has said it will base its business model on European firms such as Ireland's Ryanair. India's government has given its backing to cheaper and more accessible air travel.
