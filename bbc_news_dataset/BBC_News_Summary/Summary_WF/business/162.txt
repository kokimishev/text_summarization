 MCI exited bankruptcy in April, having gone bust under previous name WorldCom. Former Worldcom boss Bernie Ebbers is currently on trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. MCI is the US's second-biggest long distance firm after AT&T. Buying MCI would give either Qwest or Verizon access to MCI's global network and business-based subscribers.
