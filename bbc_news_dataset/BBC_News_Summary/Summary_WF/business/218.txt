 Absa and Barclays talks continueSouth Africa biggest retail bank Absa has said it is still in talks with UK bank Barclays over the sale of majority stake in the group. In November, Absa said it was close to striking a deal with Barclays. Absa also announced that it expects to see earnings grow by 20-25% in its current financial year. If Barclays buys a stake in Absa it will be one of the largest foreign investments in South Africa in recent years. Absa currently has a market value of about $8.5bn (Â£4.4bn). Analysts said Absa's earnings forecast was better than expected.
