 Speaking in court, Mr Ebbers rejected allegations he pressured ex-chief financial officer Scott Sullivan to falsify company financial statements. Mr Sullivan "made accounting decisions," he told the federal court, saying his finance chief had "a keen command of the numbers". Mr Ebbers has denied charges of fraud and conspiracy. However during the case on Tuesday Mr Ebbers denied the allegations. "I was not advised by Scott Sullivan of anything ever being wrong," he told the court. If he had, we would not be here today."
