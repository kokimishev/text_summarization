 Bush budget seeks deep cutbacksPresident Bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (£230bn) this year. The $2.58 trillion (£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to Congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health. Military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn. Congress will spend several months debating George W Bush's proposal. Mr Bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his Millennium Challenge Corporation. Yet Mr Bush's proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn. Some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. Spending is forecast to grow by 3.5% to $2.57 trillion. But the budget is still the tightest yet under Mr Bush's presidency. Mr Bush has promised to halve the US's massive budget deficit within five years. Most Republicans, however, want them to stay in place.
