 India opens skies to competitionIndia will allow domestic commercial airlines to fly long haul international routes, a move it hopes will stoke competition and drive down prices. Jet Airways and Air Sahara are the two companies that will benefit initially. India is looking to develop its airline industry as booming economic growth drives demand for travel. Monica Chadha, BBC Delhi reporter, said air travel in India had increased by almost 20% from the previous year and was expected to rise even further.
