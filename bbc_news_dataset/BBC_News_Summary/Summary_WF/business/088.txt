 Metlife buys up Citigroup insurerUS banking giant Citigroup has sold its Travelers Life & Annuity insurance arm to Metlife for $11.5bn (Â£6.1bn). Profit growth in the insurance market has not matched expansion at Citigroup's other businesses. For Metlife, the US's leading insurance company, the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network. Under the agreement, Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next 10 years. The deal includes Smith Barney retail brokerages and Citibank branches. Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m. It has total net assets of $96bn.
