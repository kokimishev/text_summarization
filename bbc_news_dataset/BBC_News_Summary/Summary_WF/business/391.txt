 Yukos lawyers now say the auction violated US bankruptcy law. The company wants damages of $20bn, claiming Yuganskneftegas was sold at less than market value. Lifting the injunction would remove the uncertainty that surrounds the court case and clarify Deutsche Bank's business position, analysts said. Analysts are not optimistic about Yukos' chances in court. On top of that, the firm only has limited assets in the US. Yukos has won small victories, however, and is bullish about its chances in court. We think we do," said Mike Lake, a Yukos spokesman.
