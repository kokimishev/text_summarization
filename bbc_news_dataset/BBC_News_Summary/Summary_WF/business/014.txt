 Telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobsThe Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff. The Telegraph Group says the cuts are needed to fund an Â£150m investment in new printing facilities. The two Telegraph titles currently employ 521 journalists. The Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. The brothers are currently mulling the sale of another of their businesses, retailer Littlewoods. Telegraph executive Murdoch MacLennan said the two newspapers would add eight colour pages in the coming months.
