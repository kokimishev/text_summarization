 Standard Life cuts policy bonusesStandard Life, Europe's largest mutual life insurer, has cut bonuses for with-profit policyholders. It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. The insurer blamed the cuts on poor share returns and low interest rates. Slumping share prices throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. Standard Life came in for criticism for sticking with stock market investments during 2001 and 2002. Recently, Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates. However, Mr Gill maintained that with-profits continued to perform well over the long term. Standard Life has an estimated 2.4 million with-profits policyholders.
