 China suspends 26 power projectsChina has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.
