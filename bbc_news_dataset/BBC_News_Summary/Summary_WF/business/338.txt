 Police detain Chinese milk bossesChinese police have detained three top executives at milk firm Yili, with reports suggesting that they are being investigated for embezzlement. Yili - full name Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial - confirmed its chairman, chief financial officer and securities representative were all in custody. The company, China's third-largest milk producer, is to hold an emergency meeting to debate the issue. A Yili spokesman said it may now move to oust chairman Zheng Junhuai. Yili has recently been the subject of intense media speculation over its financial operations. Yili's shares were suspended on Tuesday, having fallen by 10% on Monday.
