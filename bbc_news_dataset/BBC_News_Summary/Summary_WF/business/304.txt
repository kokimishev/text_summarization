 Paul Tellier, who was also Bombardier's president, left the company amid an ongoing restructuring. Analysts said the resignations seem to have stemmed from a boardroom dispute. Mr Tellier had indicated he wanted to stay at the world's top train maker and third largest manufacturer of civil aircraft until the restructuring was complete. But Bombardier has been faced with a declining share price and profits. Bombardier said restructuring plans drawn up by Mr Tellier's would continue to be implemented.
