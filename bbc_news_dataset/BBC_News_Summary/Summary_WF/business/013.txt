 Peugeot deal boosts MitsubishiStruggling Japanese car maker Mitsubishi Motors has struck a deal to supply French car maker Peugeot with 30,000 sports utility vehicles (SUV). The alliance comes as a badly-needed boost for loss-making Mitsubishi, after several profit warnings and poor sales. As a result, the Japanese car maker has sought a series of financial bailouts. It has been making cars for Nissan since 2003.
