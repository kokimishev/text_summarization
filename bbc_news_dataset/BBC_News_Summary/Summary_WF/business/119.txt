 Interest rates rose five times between November 2003 and August 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. Bank of England governor Mervyn King has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the MPC is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts. "The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, " he said. "Growth appears stronger and the MPC may become more concerned about inflation trends." Business groups welcomed the MPC's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. "We believe that these demands should be firmly resisted," said David Frost, BCC director general. Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an "interesting" challenge.
