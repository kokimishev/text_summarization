 Yangtze Electric's profits doubleYangtze Electric Power, the operator of China's Three Gorges Dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004. As a hydroelectric-power generator it has not been hurt by higher coal costs. Net income jumped to 3bn yuan in 2004 ($365m; Â£190m), compared with 1.4bn yuan in 2003. Sales surged to 6.2bn yuan, from 3bn yuan a year earlier. The figures topped analysts expectations, even though the rate of growth has slowed from 2003. Yangtze Electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by China's booming economy. That has led to an energy crunch, with demand outstripping supply. A total of 30 large-scale projects have been halted across the country for similar reasons.
