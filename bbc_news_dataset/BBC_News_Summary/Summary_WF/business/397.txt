 Green reports shun supply chainNearly 20% more UK top 250 firms produced non-financial reports on social and environment issues than last year. But of the 145 companies reporting, 76% did not examine their supply chains, says the annual Directions survey. The survey is published by corporate social responsibility firm Context and branding firm SalterBaxter. Less than a quarter of companies (24%) get their corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports independently verified to provide assurances they are accurate and complete, says the survey. The reports surveyed by Directions are published voluntarily. They are usually called corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports, sustainability reports, or social and environmental reports. Peter Knight, director of Context, says 24 UK top 250 companies reported for the first time this year and, in general, the quality of reports has improved. The US seems to lag Europe in producing corporate social responsibility reports.
