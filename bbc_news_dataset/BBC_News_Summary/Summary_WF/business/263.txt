 Split-caps pay £194m compensationInvestors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.
