 GM issues 2005 profits warningGeneral Motors has warned that it expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005. "We're following a roadmap that we believe will deliver strong results," said GM chief executive Rick Waggoner. GM said it was expecting "reduced financial losses" in Europe in 2005. GMAC has been a strong contributor to profits in 2004 but GM said it will do less well this year, delivering net income of $2.5bn. "Attaining earnings of $10 a share remains GM's goal," the company said, adding it believes it can achieve this in 2007.
