 Energy and telecommunication stocks performed particularly well, recording an 8%-10% rise since Monday morning. In 2002, the KSE was the world's best performing stock market, with the index rising 112%. Pakistani investors are expecting the KSE to repeat, if not improve on, its 2002 performance. "That's rubbish," KSE chairman Yaseen Lakhani told the BBC News website. "Whenever the market reflects Pakistan's true economic reality, it is described as a bubble." Market analysts are inclined to agree with Mr Lakhani, arguing that there are a number of major factors behind the KSE's performance. Standard & Poor's upgraded Pakistan a few weeks ago. A lot of Arab money, he says, has already gone to Malaysia and Indonesia. Locally, too, say analysts, recent political developments have worked to the market's advantage. "You can call it a peace dividend," smiles one broker.
