 Manchester United revealed on Sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from Mr Glazer. The board is obliged to consider this deal. They have all spoken out against the bid. Mr Glazer's latest move is being led by Mr Glazer's two sons, Avi and Joel, according to the Financial Times. A proposal was received by David Gill, United's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. "I do not think there is anything that Manchester United fans can do about it," he told the BBC. Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. For his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of United's largest shareholders, the Irish horseracing tycoons JP McManus and John Magnier. They own 29% of United through their Cubic Expression investment vehicle. Mr Glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. But it is not yet known whether Mr McManus and Mr Magnier would support a Glazer bid. NM Rothschild, the investment bank, is advising Mr Glazer, according to the Financial Times. But the FT said it thought JP Morgan may still have had some role in financing Mr Glazer's latest financial proposal.
