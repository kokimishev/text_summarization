 A previous approach to the United board by Mr Glazer in October last year was turned down. Mr Glazer's previous offer involved borrowing large amounts of money to finance any takeover. However, Mr Glazer's latest offer is reported to have cut the amount of borrowing needed by Â£200m. While United's board may be casting a serious eye over Mr Glazer's latest proposals, supporters remain fiercely opposed to any deal. Supporters' group Shareholders United - which has proved adept in rallying opposition to Mr Glazer's campaign - said it would fight any move. "Manchester United are a debt-free company. United's players also appear unhappy at the prospect of a takeover. Mr Glazer owns 28.1%. Indeed it is. No bid emerged, but Mr Glazer continued to increase his holding in the club. In October 2004, Manchester United said they had received a "preliminary approach", which turned out to have come from Mr Glazer. However, the board rejected the move because of the amount of debt it would involve.
