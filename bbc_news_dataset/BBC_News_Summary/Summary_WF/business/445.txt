 Executive trio leave Aer LingusThree senior executives of Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, are set to leave early on 28 January after accusations of a conflict of interest. The trio are chief executive Willie Walsh, chief financial officer Brian Dunne and chief operations officer Seamus Kearney. The three have refused to confirm reports they plan to launch a private airline in competition with Aer Lingus. They announced in November they would quit in May, but did not give a reason. "What I do after I leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say," Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday. "I have opportunities open to me. "There's absolutely no question of a conflict of interest. I have been completely focused on my responsibilities at Aer Lingus," he told AP. Last Friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for Aer Lingus.
