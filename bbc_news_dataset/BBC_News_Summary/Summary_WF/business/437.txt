 China bans new tobacco factoriesThe world's biggest tobacco consumer, China, has said it will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built. China already has more than enough cigarette-making capacity, according to a spokesman for the tobacco industry regulator quoted in China Daily. The ban threatens to reignite tensions between the regulator and British American Tobacco, which plans to become China's first foreign cigarette maker. A spokeswoman for Bat declined to comment on the report. China has 350 million smokers who consumer 1.7 trillion cigarettes a year. More young, urban woman are taking up smoking too. Bat consistently declines to comment. "Xing's statement comes as especially bad news for British American Tobacco", the China Daily newspaper said of the latest development. The Bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress. China's tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the West.
