 Mr Ebbers is on trial for fraud and conspiracy in relation to WorldCom's collapse in 2002. He pleads not guilty. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances. "On that date, yes. I was lying," replied Mr Sullivan. Mr Weingarten has suggested that Mr Sullivan is implicating Mr Ebbers only to win a lighter sentence, something Mr Sullivan denies. The trial of Mr Ebbers is now into its third week. Mr Sullivan claims that Mr Ebbers refused to stop the fraud.
