 Russia WTO talks 'make progress'Talks on Russia's proposed membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) have been "making good progress" say those behind the negotiations. His comments came as President George W Bush said the US backed Russian entry. His comments come three days before he is due to meet President Vladimir Putin. Russia has been waiting for a decade to join the WTO and hopes to finally become a member by early 2006. A decision could be reached in December, when the WTO's 148 current members gather for a summit in Hong Kong. That would allow an earliest date for membership of January 2006, if the Hong Kong summit gave its approval. Mr Johannesson also said progress "on the bilateral market access side is accelerating". Some WTO members also dislike Russia's energy price subsidies, which competitors say give Russian businesses an unfair advantage.
