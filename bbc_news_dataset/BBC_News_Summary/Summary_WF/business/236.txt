 But the clampdown has caused fraudsters to change tack, Retail Decisions said. Nearly two thirds - 65% - of the 1,000 people interviewed said they had used chip and pin to make payments. However, only 34% said they had received replacement cards with the necessary 'chip' technology from all their card providers. Altogether, card scams on UK-issued cards totalled £402.4m in 2003. Card-not-present fraud rose an annual 6% to £116.4m, making it the biggest category even then. Within this, internet fraud totalled £43m, Apacs' figures show.
