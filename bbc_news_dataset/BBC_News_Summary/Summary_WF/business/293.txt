 Glazer makes new Man Utd approachMalcolm Glazer has made a fresh approach to buy Manchester United, which could lead to a bid valuing the Premiership club at Â£800m. Mr Glazer, who owns the Tampa Bay Buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. His new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. Man United had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. Last week, however, Mr Glazer issued a statement to the Stock Exchange distancing himself from a new bid. Meanwhile, United's chief executive David Gill said in December that talks would not resume unless Glazer came up with "definitive proposals". United fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. "The campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since Glazer first showed interest in the club."
