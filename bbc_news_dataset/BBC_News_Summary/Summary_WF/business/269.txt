 Air China plans to raise $1bn (Â£514m) from the flotation. Share trading will begin on 15 December, the LSE said. "We are delighted that Air China has chosen London for its listing outside China," said LSE chief executive Clara Furse. Air China's primary listing will be in Hong Kong, with a secondary listing in London. The shares will be denominated in Hong Kong dollars. However, investors may be wary of Chinese stocks.
