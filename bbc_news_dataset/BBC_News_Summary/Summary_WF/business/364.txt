 Durex maker SSL awaits firm bidUK condom maker SSL International has refused to comment on reports it may be subject to a takeover early in 2005. A Financial Times report said business intelligence firm GPW was understood to be starting due diligence work on SSL International, for a corporate client. An spokesman for SSL, which makes the famous Durex brand of condom, would not to comment on "market speculation". The FT said most the high-profile firm that might woo SSL was Anglo-Dutch household products group Reckitt Benckiser. Other firms that have been seen as would-be suitors include Kimberly-Clark, Johnson & Johnson, and private equity investors. Analysts have seen SSL as a takeover target for years. SSL was formed by a three-way merger between Seton Healthcare, footwear specialists Scholl and condom-maker London International Group.
