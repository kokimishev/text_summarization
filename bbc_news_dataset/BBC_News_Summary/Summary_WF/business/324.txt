 Yukos seeks court action on saleYukos will return to a US court on Wednesday to seek sanctions against Baikal Finance Group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset. Yukos' US lawyers will attempt to have Baikal assets frozen after the Russian government ignored a US court order last week blocking the sale. On Wednesday, Yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group.
