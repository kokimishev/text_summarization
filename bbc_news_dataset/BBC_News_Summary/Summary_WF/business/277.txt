 Turkey turns on the economic charmThree years after a gruelling economic crisis, Turkey has dressed its economy to impress. The economy is growing fast, they insist. Unemployment levels, in percentage terms, are heading fast towards single digits. Inflation is under control. And following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts, its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent. "Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget." However, Turkey's assertions are confirmed by Brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy. But only over time. "At about 80% of GDP, Turkey's gross debt is double that figure." But economics is not a science.
