 Without major changes in current policies and political prejudices, the federal budget simply cannot hold together. This upward trend will force increased borrowing by the federal government, putting upward pressure on interest rates faced by consumers and business. Even now, a growing share of US borrowing is from abroad. This does not bode well for US influence in the world. The dollar is already sinking. Before too long, credit markets are likely to react, and interest rates will creep upwards. That will be the shock. The public outcry will force Congress to act. Whether it will act wisely is another matter. Federal revenues are at 1950s levels, while spending remains where it has been in recent decades - much higher. In addition, the United States has two significant military missions. The Bush administration's chosen remedy is the least feasible one. It's fantasy to think these routine government functions could be slashed. To some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable. The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. Brute force budget cuts or spending caps would ill-serve the nation's elderly and indigent. Finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. There is no good reason to fixate on it, anyway. Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. The sooner we face that reality, the sooner workable reforms can be pursued.
