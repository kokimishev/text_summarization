 Christmas sales worst since 1981UK retail sales fell in December, failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst Christmas since 1981. A number of retailers have already reported poor figures for December. The last time retailers endured a tougher Christmas was 23 years previously, when sales plunged 1.7%. The November-December jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages, although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. However, reports from some High Street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. And a British Retail Consortium survey found that Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years.
