 Many investors believe that Mr Bush's policies are more business-friendly than those of his Democrat challenger, John Kerry. Share prices in London, Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher. Senator Kerry attacked President Bush's economic record during his campaign, hammering home the fact that a net 800,000 jobs were lost during his term in office. Senator Kerry planned to increase taxes on those earning more than $200,000 a year. However, economists have said both candidates' economic programmes rested on questionable assumptions about future growth.
