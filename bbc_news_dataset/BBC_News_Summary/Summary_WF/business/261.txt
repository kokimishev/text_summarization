 Booming markets shed few tearsThe market, former British government minister Michael Heseltine once said, has no morality. And indeed, stock exchange traders around Asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week's disaster. Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week; even in Sri Lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit. Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. In fact, the markets are being perfectly rational. For a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. Indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. Second, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. Tourist businesses, the most likely sufferers, are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. Those that are listed have suffered: Confifi Hotel Holdings, a small Sri Lankan tourism firm, has halved in value this week. Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. In Indonesia, shares in state construction companies Adhi Karya and Semen Gresik have jumped sharply this week. More broadly, the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact. But disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors. In fact, again, the risks here are lower than they seem. The trillion-dollar debts of Japan's banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo. "It is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings," one Bombay trader said this week. Business sense probably tends to overrule everything else."
