 Newest EU members underpin growthThe European Union's newest members will bolster Europe's economic growth in 2005, according to a new report. The eight central European states which joined the EU last year will see 4.6% growth, the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) said. UNECE is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the European Union in 2005. On Monday, Germany's BdB private banks association said the German economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005. Publishing its 2005 economic survey, the UNECE said central European countries such as the Czech Republic and Slovenia would provide the backbone of the continent's growth.
