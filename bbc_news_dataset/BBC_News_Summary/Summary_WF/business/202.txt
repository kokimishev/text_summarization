 The lawsuit was filed on Friday after Qwest Communications, which had an earlier offer for MCI rejected, said it would submit an improved bid. MCI's directors have backed Verizon, despite it tabling less money. Qwest said on Wednesday that MCI had rejected a deal worth $8bn. MCI's directors have argued that Verizon is bigger than Qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. However, the firm - now renamed MCI - has put its operations in order and emerged from bankruptcy protection last April. MCI shares jumped on Friday, hitting their highest level since April 2004 amid speculation that it would be the focus of a bidding war.
