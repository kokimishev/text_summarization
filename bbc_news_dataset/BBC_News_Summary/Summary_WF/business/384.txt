 Weak end-of-year sales hit NextNext has said its annual profit will be Â£5m lower than previously expected because its end-of-year clearance sale has proved disappointing. "Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations," the company said. Next's shares fell more than 3% following the release of the trading statement. This figure is for existing Next stores, which were unaffected by new Next store openings. Like-for-like sales growth at the 49 Next stores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was 0.5%. Overall sales across both its retail and mail order divisions were up 12.4%, Next said. Its Next Directory mail order division saw sales rise 13.4% during the five-month period.
