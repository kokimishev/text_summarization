 Gross domestic product (GDP) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. The economy contracted in 2003. Foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. The European Central Bank (ECB) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on Thursday. Economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite. "If exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005." Major companies including Volkswagen, DaimlerChrysler and Siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs.
