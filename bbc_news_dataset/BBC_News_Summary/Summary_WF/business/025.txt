 Yukos loses US bankruptcy battleA judge has dismissed an attempt by Russian oil giant Yukos to gain bankruptcy protection in the US. Yukos filed for Chapter 11 protection in Houston in an unsuccessful attempt to halt the auction of its Yugansk division by the Russian authorities. The court ruling is a blow to efforts to get damages for the sale of Yugansk, which Yukos claims was illegally sold. Separately, former Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky began testimony on Friday in his trial for fraud and tax evasion. Yugansk was auctioned to help pay off $27.5bn (Â£14.5bn) in unpaid taxes. Texas Judge Letitia Clark said Yukos did not have enough of a US presence to establish US jurisdiction. "The vast majority of the business and financial activities of Yukos continue to occur in Russia," Judge Clark said in her ruling. "Such activities require the continued participation of the Russian government." Russia had indicated it would in any case not abide by the rulings of the US courts. But she said her role was simply to decide on jurisdiction. Yukos said it would consider its options in light of the ruling. However, it claimed that the court had backed its argument in four out of five key issues. "Our assets were illegally seized. We want them back or damages paid."
