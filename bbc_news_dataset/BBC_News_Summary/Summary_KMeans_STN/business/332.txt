Rosneft is already in the process of merging with Gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, a move that will see Gazprom return to majority state-ownership. "Now the state, using market methods, is safeguarding its interests. "Everything was done by market methods," Mr Putin said at his year-end press conference in Moscow. Baikal was the surprise buyer of oil and gas giant Yukos's main production division at a forced auction on Sunday. "The government is renationalising Yuganskneftegas." Gazprom, the company originally tipped to buy Yuganskneftegas, was banned from taking part in the auction by a US court injunction. Further muddying the waters is a merger between Rosneft and Gazprom which authorities have said will go ahead as planned. Lawyers claimed the auction was illegal because Yukos - with an office in Houston - had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were under the protection of US law which has worldwide jurisdiction.
