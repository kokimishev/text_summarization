The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. "The risk is that after they have invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle," said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe. The price of the car has also gone up. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to Â£15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers.
