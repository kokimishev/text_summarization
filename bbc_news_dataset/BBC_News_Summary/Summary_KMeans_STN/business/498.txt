Millions go missing at China bankTwo senior officials at one of China's top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $120m (Â£64m) went missing. The other is China Construction Bank. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks.
