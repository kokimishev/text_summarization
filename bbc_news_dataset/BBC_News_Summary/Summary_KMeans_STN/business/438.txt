The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade. "But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. Mr Frost added: "The housing market outlook remains highly uncertain. "So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing," said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. "It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably." The Bank remains concerned about the long-term risks posed by personal debt - which is rising at 15% a year - if economic conditions worsen.
