And the 101-year-old Torao Toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life. Mr Toshitsune is one of Japan's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. "On average, we can live longer." "Who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? Mr Toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. But, as yet, Japan is not ready for an Ellis Island. "Japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas," says Mr Wood. After a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP), the highest rate among industrialised countries. Japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the US. But none of this is Mr Toshitsune's concern anymore.
