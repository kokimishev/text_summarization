The two firms are expected to seal the deal on Monday morning, according to news agency reports, despite what was thought to be a higher bid from Qwest. Shareholders lost about $180bn when the company collapsed, while 20,000 workers lost their jobs. The US telecoms market is consolidating fast, with former long-distance giant AT&T being bought by former subsidiary SBC earlier this year for $16bn. A merger between MCI and Verizon would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since October. The rationale is similar to the one underpinning SBC's AT&T deal. Consolidation in the US telecommunications industry has picked up in the past few months as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases.
