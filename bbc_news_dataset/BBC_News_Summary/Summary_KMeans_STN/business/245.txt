From the standpoint of the big fiscal trends, the cuts are gratuitous and the big budget train wreck is yet to come. Whether it will act wisely is another matter. The US population is aging, and the nation does face genuine threats in the world. Finally, blind allegiance to a balanced budget will have to be abandoned. How did this happen? The Bush administration's chosen remedy is the least feasible one. Under direct threat will be the federal government's ability to make good on its debts to the Social Security Trust Fund. Second should be a dispassionate re-evaluation of the huge increase in defence spending over the past three years, much of it unrelated to Afghanistan, Iraq, or terrorism. Reducing domestic spending, or eliminating "waste, fraud and abuse" is toothless because this slice of the budget is too small to solve the problem. Moderate deficits and slowly rising federal debt can be sustained indefinitely. To some extent, increases in these areas are inevitable.
