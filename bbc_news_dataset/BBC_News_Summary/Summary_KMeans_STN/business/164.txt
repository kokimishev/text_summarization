Yukos called the sale illegal and has turned to courts in the US in an effort to regain control of the oil production business. It also has submitted a reorganisation plan as part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. Earlier this month it sued the Russian government for $28.3bn. As well as suing for damages, Yukos has asked the US court to send its tax dispute with the Russian government to an international arbitrator. To settle the bill, Russia forced Yukos to sell off Yuganskneftegas. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control.
