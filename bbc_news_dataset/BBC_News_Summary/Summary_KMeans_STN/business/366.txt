A report from investment firm Grant Samuel in WMC defence documents values WMC shares at A$7.17 to A$8.24, against Xstrata's bid of A$6.35 a share. There is now pressure on Swiss-based Xstrata to increase its takeover offer. Analysts said the defence documents provided more details on WMC, and may trigger a possible rival bid. Marc Gonsalves, an executive at Xstrata, said: "We will review the information contained in the target's statement over the next week or so." "Any longer term commodity price improvements would only improve our outlook," Mr Michelmore said. And WMC chief executive Andrew Michelmore claimed the Xstrata offer was aimed at creating value for Xstrata's shareholders, and was not being made for the benefit of WMC's shareholders. WMC Resources is the world's third-largest producer of concentrated nickel, and also a miner of copper and uranium.
