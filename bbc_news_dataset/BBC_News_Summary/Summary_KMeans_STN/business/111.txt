The company, which has had dual headquarters in Rotterdam and London since 1930, will announce the location of its head office at a later date. "While it is certainly the case that markets have been tougher in the past eighteen months than we had expected, we have also lost some market share," said Mr Cescau. Shares fell 1% to 510.75 pence in London, and dropped by 1.2% to 50.50 euros in Amsterdam. Sales of Slimfast products have been hit in recent years by the popularity of the Atkins diet. The company also cited difficult trading conditions and a lack of demand for goods such as its Slimfast range. In Asia, leading products came under "attack" from rivals such as Procter & Gamble. "Our objective is to reverse the share loss that we experienced in some markets in 2004 and return to growth."
