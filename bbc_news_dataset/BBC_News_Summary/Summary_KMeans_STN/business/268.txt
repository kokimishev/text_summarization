Giving financial gifts to childrenYour child or grandchild may want the latest toy this Christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future? Gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. As the Child Trust Fund will not be in force in time for Christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund. Parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in April 2005. If the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. Where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. Some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the Ladybird account from the Saffron Walden Building Society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of £1 and the Alliance & Leicester FirstSaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at £1. There are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. The minimum for each purchase is £100 and Bonds are sold in multiples of £10. Only £100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free.
