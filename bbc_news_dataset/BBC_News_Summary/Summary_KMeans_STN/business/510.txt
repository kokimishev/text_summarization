Lacroix label bought by US firmLuxury goods group LVMH has sold its loss-making Christian Lacroix clothing label to a US investment group. The Falic Group bought two cosmetics labels from LVMH in 2003. The Florida-based Falic group, which also runs a chain of 90 duty free stores in the US, said it planned to expand the brand by opening new stores. Mr Lacroix said he planned to stay at the label he founded in 1987 although exact details are still to be confirmed.
