On Monday, Germany's BdB private banks association said the German economy would struggle to meet its 1.4% growth target in 2005. The UK economy, on the other hand, is expected to slow in 2005, with growth falling from 3.2% last year to 2.5%. Smaller nations such as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta would also be among the continent's best performing economies this year, it said. Separately, the Bundesbank warned that Germany's efforts to reduce its budget deficit below 3% of GDP presented "huge risks" given that headline economic growth was set to fall below 1% this year. UNECE is forecasting average economic growth of 2.2% across the European Union in 2005. The UNECE warned that attempts to bring about a controlled reduction in the US current account deficit could cause difficulties.
