Plasma display panels are used for large, thin TVs which are replacing old-style televisions. They said the agreement would enable the two companies to expand the plasma display TV market globally. Sharp will inherit staff, manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from Fujitsu. Samsung Electronics and Sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development. Separately, Fujitsu announced on Monday that it is quitting the LCD panel market by transferring its operations in the area to Japanese manufacturer Sharp.
