The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) index fell to 55.3 in February, from an adjusted 56.4 in January. "February was another good month in the manufacturing sector," said ISM survey chairman Norbert Ore."While the overall rate of growth is slowing, the overall picture is improving as price increases and shortages are becoming less of a problem. Analysts had expected February's figure to be stronger than January's and come in at 57. The ISM's index of national manufacturing activity is compiled from the responses of purchasing executives at more than 400 industrial companies.
