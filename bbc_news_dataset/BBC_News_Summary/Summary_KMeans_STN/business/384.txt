The High Street retailer said it now expected to report annual profits of between £415m and £425m ($779m-798m). Among areas where Next could have done better, Mr Wolfson said menswear ranges were "a little bit too similar to the previous year". Like-for-like sales growth at the 49 Next stores directly affected by new store openings in their locality was 0.5%. Next's shares fell more than 3% following the release of the trading statement. "Clearance rates in our end-of-season sale have been below our expectations," the company said. "Profits of around £420m would be well within the comfort zone."
