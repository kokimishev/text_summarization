The agreement in question dates back to GM's decision to buy 20% of Fiat's auto division in 2000. Mr Marchionne is confident of his firm's legal position, saying in an interview with the Financial Times that GM's argument "has no legs". Both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand. However, GM argues that a Fiat share sale made last year, which cut GM's holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by Fiat have terminated the agreement. "We are not expecting Fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling GM at this point," brokerage Merrill Lynch said in a note to investors, adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business. "Fiat may be willing to cancel the 'put' in exchange for money."
