He said if the growth continued at this level then the Bank of England may increase interest rates from their current 4.75%. Overall, mortgage lending rose by £7.2bn in January, marginally up on the £7.1bn rise in December. "We are not seeing the market collapsing in the way some had feared," said Nationwide economist Alex Bannister. Homeowners now expect house prices to rise by 1% over the next six months, Mr Bannister said. "I think the key is what the Bank expects to happen to the housing market. The past few months have seen approvals fall to levels last seen in 1995. The Bank revealed that 48,000 fewer mortgages were approved in January than for the same month in 2004.
