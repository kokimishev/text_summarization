Hyundai expects its sales in India to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005. This will boost the annual production capacity of the company - India's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. The company did not give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year. The new plant will be built close to the existing one in Chennai, in the southern province of Tamil Nadu. "We desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the Indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors," chairman Chung Mong-koo said in the statement.
