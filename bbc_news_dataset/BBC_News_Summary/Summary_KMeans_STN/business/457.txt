Countries which exceed the threshold are liable to heavy fines by the European Commission, although several countries, including Germany, have breached the rules consistently since 2002 without facing punishment. A number of EU finance ministers are believed to favour only limited changes to the eurozone's rules. Mr Schroeder said existing fiscal rules should be loosened to allow countries to run deficits above the current 3% limit if they met certain criteria. "Only if their competences are respected will the member states be willing to align their policies more consistently with the economic goals of the EU." The issue will also be discussed at Tuesday's Ecofin meeting of the finance ministers of all 25 EU members. These include governments which are adopting costly structural reforms, countries which are suffering economic stagnation and nations which are shouldering "special economic burdens".
