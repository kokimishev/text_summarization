Bank opts to leave rates on holdThe Bank of England has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row. Data on Wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since May last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts. And recent house surveys from the Halifax and Nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. "The economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, " he said. Ian McCafferty, chief economist at the CBI, said the MPC faced an "interesting" challenge. "Manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures."
