The increase in sales during December pushed total spending for the month to $349.4bn (Â£265.9bn). During that time, sales grew a lacklustre 2.9% in 2001 and 2.5% a year later. The gains were led by a 4.3% jump in auto sales as dealers used enhanced offers to get cars out of showrooms. "Consumers for now remain willing to spend freely, sustaining the US expansion. Given that attitude, the Fed remains likely to continue boosting the Fed funds rate at upcoming meetings," UBS economist Maury Harris told Reuters. However, analysts said that the strong figures were unlikely to put the Federal Reserve Bank off its current policy of measured interest rate rises.
