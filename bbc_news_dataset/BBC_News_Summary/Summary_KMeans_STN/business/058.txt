Electrolux to export Europe jobsElectrolux saw its shares rise 14% on Tuesday after it said it would be shifting more of its manufacturing to low-cost countries. It did not say which facilities would be affected, but intends moving them to Asia, eastern Europe and Mexico. It makes lawn and garden products in Newton Aycliffe, and cookers and ovens in Spennymoor. "We see that about half the plants in high-cost countries - that is around 10 - are at risk," said Electrolux chief executive Hans Straberg. "What are we going to end up producing in Sweden?"
