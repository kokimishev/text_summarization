Now, GW Pharma's Sativex mouth spray could be legally available to MS sufferers in Canada within the next few months. The UK government granted GW Pharma a licence to grow the cannabis plant for medical research purposes. This will be the first time a cannabis-based drug has been approved anywhere in the world, representing a landmark for GW Pharma and for patients with MS. Thousands of plants are grown at a secret location somewhere in the English countryside. "We are delighted to receive this qualifying notice from Health Canada and look forward to receiving regulatory approval for Sativex in Canada in the early part of 2005," said GW Pharma executive chairman Dr Geoffrey Guy. The latest news sent shares in GW Pharma up 8.5p, or 8.1%, to 113.5p.
