UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and South African President Thabo Mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. "Global warming" features particularly high. Davos itself is in deep frost. Ultimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. "Taking responsibility for tough choices" is this year's official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. However, many of the issues discussed in Porto Alegre are Davos talking points as well. The organisers also hope that the new Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three Israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes Shimon Peres. Mr Gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with Brazil's President Lula da Silva.
