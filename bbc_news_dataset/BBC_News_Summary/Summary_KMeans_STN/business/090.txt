The package was announced by agriculture minister Dominique Bussereau after talks with vintners' representatives. Efforts to promote French wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding. Wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough.

"I am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions," Jean-Michel Lemetayer, from the FNSEA agricultural union, told the Associated Press news agency. Production is currently outstripping demand by about 30%.
