France Telecom, one of the world's largest telecoms and internet service providers, saw its full-year sales rise 2.2% to 47.2bn euros in 2004. France Telecom is to spend 578m euros on buying out minority shareholders in data services provider Equant. Orange added more than five million new customers in 2004, leading to a 10% increase in its revenues. "Our results for 2004 allow us to improve our financial structure while focusing on the innovation that drives our strategy," said chief executive Thierry Breton. The firm said it had met its main strategic objectives of growing its individual businesses and further reducing its large debt. However, this has now been reduced to 43.9bn euros.
