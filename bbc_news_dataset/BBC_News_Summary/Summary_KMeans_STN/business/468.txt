EU to probe Alitalia 'state aid'The European Commission has officially launched an in-depth investigation into whether Italian airline Alitalia is receiving illegal state aid. "We now have to verify certain aspects to confirm that this plan contains no state aid. The matter of possible state aid was brought to the Commission's attention by eight of Alitalia's rivals, including Germany's Lufthansa, British Airways and Spain's Iberia. "The Italian authorities have presented a serious industrial plan," said Mr Barot. Alitalia already enjoyed state aid in 1997. While Alitalia needs to restructure to bring itself back to profitability, the rival carriers say it has both violated state aid rules and threatened competition.
