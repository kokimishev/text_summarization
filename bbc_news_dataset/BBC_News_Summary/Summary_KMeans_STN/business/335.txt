Airbus this week announced the first pre-sale of its 7E7 rival - the A350. Boeing's great European competitor is to sell 10 of its forthcoming A350 to Spanish carrier Air Europe, which has the option to buy two more in a deal that could be worth more than $1.8bn. Japan Airlines said it had looked at both aircraft before choosing the 7E7, also known as the Dreamliner. Airbus hopes to have 50 orders in place for the A350 by mid-2005. "The 7E7 fits better for what we needed and it could be delivered when we hoped to get it."
