Vodafone appoints new Japan bossVodafone has drafted in its UK chief executive William Morrow to take charge of its troubled Japanese operation. Mr Tsuda, who will become chairman, was appointed president only two months ago but the business has struggled since then, losing customers in January. "Vodafone is going to need to put a lot of money into Japan if it wants to rebuild the business," Tetsuro Tsusaka, a telecoms analyst with Deutsche Bank, told Reuters. "I do not know if it will be worth it for them to spend that kind of money just for Japan."
