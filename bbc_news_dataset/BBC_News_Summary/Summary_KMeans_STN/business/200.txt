All conversions between the US dollar and Cuba's "convertible" peso will from 8 November be subject to a 10% tax. A leading expert on the Cuban economy says that Castro's tax plan smacks more of a desperate economic measure than a political gesture. The tax will hit the families of Cuban exiles hardest as they benefit from the money their displaced relatives send home. "The main impact could be that it will create a black market which you typically see in countries, like Venezuela, which have restrictions on capital," he says. However, a decline in foreign tourism since 2002, periodic hurricanes and the increasing costs of importing oil have put a strain on the economy. Much of Cuba's basic infrastructure is in a state of disrepair. "It underscores the fact that the economy is in very bad shape and the government is looking for sources of revenue." The tax could fuel an active black market in currency trading, Mr Barrionuevo said.
