Audi and Mercedes Benz were also supplied with the defective diesel fuel-injection pumps but neither of them have to recall any vehicles. The faulty component does not represent a safety risk but causes the motor to stall after a significant amount of mileage. The German company is to extend a planned production break at one of its plants due to the faulty Bosch part. When asked if BMW would be seeking compensation from Bosch, the carmaker's chief executive Helmut Panke said: "we will first solve the problem before talking about who will pay". A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, parent company of Mercedes Benz, said it will however have to halt some production.
