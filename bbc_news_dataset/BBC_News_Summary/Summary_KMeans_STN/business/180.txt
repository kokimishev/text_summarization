Comments by South Korea's central bank at the end of last week have sparked the recent round of dollar declines. Analysts reckon that other nations may follow suit and now ditch the dollar. At 1300 GMT, the euro was up 0.9% on the day at 1.3187 euros per US dollar. "The comments from Korea came at a time when sentiment towards the dollar was already softening," said Ian Gunner, a trader at Mellon Financial. A report last month already showed that the dollar was losing its allure as a currency that offered rock-steady returns and stability.
