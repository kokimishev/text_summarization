The news came as Deutsche Boerse held its third meeting with the LSE since its bid approach in December which was turned down by the London exchange for undervaluing the business. But, Hans Reckers, a board member of Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, said that cash trading should also remain in Frankfurt, something Deutsche Boerse could move to the UK. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: "There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made." This has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants," he said. "It is not just the headquarters of the Boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in Frankfurt. Local government officials in Frankfurt's state of Hessen have also spoken out against the move.
