Compliance costs are already believed to be making firms wary of US listings. The Act comes into force in mid-2005. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would "continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements". It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts. He revealed that his staff were already weighing up the merits of delaying the implementation of the Act's least popular measure - Section 404 - for foreign firms. The SEC has already delayed implementation of this clause for smaller firms - including US ones - with market capitalisations below $700m (Â£374m). A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported.
