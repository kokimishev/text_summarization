The merger, backed by Russian authorities, will allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom shares. By opening up trading in Gazprom to foreigners, the firm will become a top emerging market play for traders. According to reports from Russian News Agency Interfax, the deal should go through in the next two to three months. "Obtaining majority control over Gazprom is the beginning of the liberalisation of the market in Gazprom shares," Mr Miller added. Russian oil merger excludes YukosThe merger of Russian gas giant Gazprom and oil firm Rosneft is to go ahead, but will not include Yugansk, which was controversially bought last year. Yukos unsuccessfully sought to halt the auction by applying for bankruptcy through the US courts. But he said the latest development was simply an interim step to allow foreigners to trade in Gazprom.
