Pranab Mukherjee said such companies could take advantage of India's highly skilled workers and low wages. Giants such Boeing and Airbus - on the civil aviation front - as well as Lockheed Martin and France's Snecma - on the military side - are some of the firms attending the show. "We are keen to welcome international collaborations that are in conformity with our national goals." Lockheed said it had signed an agreement with state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to share information on the P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft. "There is tremendous scope for outsourcing from India in areas where the companies are competitive," said Mr Mukerjee. In fact, the Indian Armed Force is considering the buying of used P-3 Orion as well as F-16 fighter jets from Lockheed. On the civilian front, Boeing announced a deal with India's HCL Technologies to develop a platform for the flight test system of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft.
