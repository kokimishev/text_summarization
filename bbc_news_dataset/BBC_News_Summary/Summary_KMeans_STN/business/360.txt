"With these investments, clearly we are going to continue being the principle actor in the mining of copper. Australia's BHP Billiton - which operates La Escondida, the world's largest open pit copper mine - is planning to invest $1.9bn between now and 2007, while state-owned Codelco will spend about $1bn on various projects. It's a consolidation of the industry with new projects and expansions that will support greater production." Strong demand from China's fast-growing economy and high prices have fuelled production, said Cochilco vice president Patricio Cartagena. Mr Cartagena said the industry expects to see investment worth $10bn over the next three years.
