Analysts said that the move is aimed at winning over investors opposed to its bid for the London Stock Exchange. Late on Monday, Deutsche Boerse said it would lift its 2004 dividend payment to 70 euro cents (Â£0.48; $0.98) from 55 euro cents a year earlier. Sales climbed to 364.4m euros, lifting revenue for the year to a record 1.45bn euros. "Most of the disgruntled shareholders of Deutsche Boerse are complaining that the money that is being used for the bid could be better placed in their hands, paid out in dividends," Mr Faraj continued. Deutsche Boerse is "trying to buy them off in a sense", he said.
