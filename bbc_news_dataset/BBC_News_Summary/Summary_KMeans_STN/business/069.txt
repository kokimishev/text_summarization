For Airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. Airbus, which overtook Boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos. "Airbus is now where Boeing was a few years ago" with its product range, said Flight International's Mr Learmount. Airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. From there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. It already has orders from Pakistan International Airlines and EVA of Taiwan. Net profit was $186m (Â£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.
