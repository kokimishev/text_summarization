Ministers from European and Asian governments have recently called on the US to strengthen the dollar, saying the excessively high value of the euro was starting to hurt their export-driven economies. Meanwhile, France's finance minister has said the world faced "economic catastrophe" unless the US worked with Europe and Asia on currency controls. Commerce Department data also showed consumer spending - which drives two thirds of the US economy - grew just 0.2% last month. The dollar has weakened sharply since September when it traded about $1.20, amid continuing worries over the levels of the US trade and budget deficits. "I can see it finishing the year around $1.35 and we can see that it has / it is going to be a steady track upward for the euro/dollar in 2005, finishing the year around $1.40," said Adrian Hughes, currency strategist with HSBC in London. The US says it will let market forces determine the dollar's strength rather than intervene directly.
