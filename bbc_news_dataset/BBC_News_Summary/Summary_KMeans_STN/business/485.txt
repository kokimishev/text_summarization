Meanwhile, UK-based firm Aggregate Industries said it had agreed a Â£1.8bn takeover by Holcim. The Markfield, Leicestershire-based company runs 142 quarries in the UK and the US. Peter Tom, who will remain as Aggregate chief executive, said the 138p a share offer provided "significant value" for shareholders. "The market is not impressed. If they want a substantial chunk, then they should be paying a premium over the market price."
