Dutch firm Heineken saw its annual profits drop 33% and warned that earnings in 2005 may also slide. Its beer sales have been affected by the sluggish European economy and by the banning of smoking in pubs in several European countries. Carlsberg, the world's fifth-largest brewer, saw annual pre-tax profits fall to 3.4bn Danish kroner (456m euros). Despite the dip in profits, Heineken's sales have been improving and total revenue for the year was 10bn euros, up 8.1% from 9.26bn euros in 2003. This may involve closing down breweries. "We remain cautious about the medium-to-long term outlook for revenue growth across western Europe for a host of economic, social and structural reasons," investment bank Merrill Lynch said of Carlsberg.
