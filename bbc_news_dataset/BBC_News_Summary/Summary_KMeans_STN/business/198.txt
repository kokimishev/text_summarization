"This area does need more appraisal drilling but it looks very strong," Dr Mike Watts head of exploration said. Before Christmas, Cairn revealed that drilling to the north of the field in Rajasthan had been disappointing, which caused its shares to lose 18% in one day. It also said production at its other fields across the globe was likely to surpass levels seen in 2004. The firm has applied for a 30-month extension to scout for oil outside its main development area, which includes the Mangala and Aishwariya fields where Cairn has previously announced major discoveries. Chief executive Bill Gammell added: "The more we progress in Rajasthan the better we feel about it."
