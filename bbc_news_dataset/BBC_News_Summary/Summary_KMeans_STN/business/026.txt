Safety alert as GM recalls carsThe world's biggest carmaker General Motors (GM) is recalling nearly 200,000 vehicles in the US on safety grounds, according to federal regulators. The NHTSA said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. Those vehicles with potential faults are the Chevrolet Avalanche, Express, Kodiak, Silverade and Suburban; the GMC Savana, Sierra and Yukon. This is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. In January, GM said higher healthcare costs in North America, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.
