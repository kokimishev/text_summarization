Yukos owner sues Russia for $28bnThe majority owner of embattled Russian oil firm Yukos has sued the Russian government for $28.3bn (Â£15.2bn). The Russian government's argument for selling Yuganskneftegaz - the unit has / it is full name - was that Yukos owed more than $27bn in back taxes for the years from 2000 onwards. Mr Khodorkovsky, currently facing fraud and tax evasion charges of his own, was one of the founders of Menatep. But critics say the sell-off, and the assault on Yukos' finances, are part of an attempt to bring the energy industry back under state control. Menatep said the value of its Yukos shareholding had gone from $17.8bn to "virtually nothing" since 2003 as a result of the Russian government's action, as its shares have fallen 97%. "Russia has said in the past that it is bound by it, so as to attract foreign investors," he said. Menatep has already asked Rosneft to repay a $900m loan that Yugansk had secured on its assets.
