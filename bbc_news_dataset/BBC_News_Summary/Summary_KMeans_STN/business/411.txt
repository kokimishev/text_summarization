The fall came as Indonesia said it expected debt repayments of up to 30 trillion rupiah ($3.2bn; Â£1.7bn) to be frozen to help pay for the recovery. On Monday, Indonesian economy minister Aburizal Bakrie told reporters that the Paris Club group of creditor countries was expected to freeze 20-30bn rupiah in payments due in 2005 and 2006. So far, more than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in Indonesia, the country closest to the earthquake which triggered the great wave. That cost could be defrayed by temporary debt relief. "We hope we can resume the repayments at least from 2007," Mr Bakrie said.
