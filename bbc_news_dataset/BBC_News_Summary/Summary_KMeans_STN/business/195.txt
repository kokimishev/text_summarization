The report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. It claimed revenues were likely to be Â£6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. Earlier this month, accountancy firm Ernst & Young said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic. It said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the "world economy will continue to grow strongly". "Spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable." The main cloud on the horizon, NIESR said, was the UK's much analysed and fretted over property market. GDP is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006.
