However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. At 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank's 2-3% target range. However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts. "Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited," said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank. "This suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004."
