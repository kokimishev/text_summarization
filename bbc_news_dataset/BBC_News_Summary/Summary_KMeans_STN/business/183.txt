But how many tourists look at the impressively grand Victorian Chambre de Commerce, which stands beside the Opera House, and consider that it was built - like the town halls in many northern English towns - on the wealth created by coal, steel and textiles? Which is strange because Lille is at the crossroads of Europe - if anywhere should be benefiting from the euro it is here. In Germany, industry is exporting more these days, but the economy as a whole is once again mired in slow growth and high unemployment. Growth is likely to peak this year at just under 2%. "In our business the market is absolutely global, you can not imagine living with our size (of business) even within an enlarged European Union, (if we did that) we would need not 350 people but perhaps just 150 or 200," he says. Boss Henk Addink blames the low growth rate in Europe for the lack of orders closer to home. The EU set itself the target of being the most efficient economy in the world by 2010. The Government is reforming the labour market and cutting the generous unemployment system, but the real solution is to cut the wages of low skilled workers, says Helmut Schneider, director of the Institute for the Study of Labour at Bonn University. Factory manager Herbert Stueker says that he now hopes to increase productivity "by nearly 30%". Four years into that process, and the target seems further away than ever.
