The average UK house price fell from £180,126 in November to £178,906, reflecting recent Land Registry figures confirming a slowdown in late 2004. December is traditionally a quiet month for the housing market because of Christmas celebrations. Nationally, house prices rose at an annual rate of 10.7% in December, less than the 13.7% rise the previous month. Although both the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) and the Land Registry figures point to a slowdown in the market, the most recent surveys from Nationwide and Halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival.
