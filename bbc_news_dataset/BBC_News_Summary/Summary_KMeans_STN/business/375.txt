S Korean credit card firm rescuedSouth Korea's largest credit card firm has averted liquidation following a one trillion won ($960m; Â£499m) bail-out. A consortium of creditors and LG Group, a family owned conglomerate, have each put up $480m to stabilise the firm. LG Card had been threatened with collapse because of its huge debts but the firm's creditors and its former parent have stepped in to rescue it. "LG Card will not need any more financial aid after this," Laah Chong-gyu, executive director of Korea Development Bank - one of the firm's creditors - said. South Korea's stock exchange can delist any firm if its debt exceeds its assets two years running.
