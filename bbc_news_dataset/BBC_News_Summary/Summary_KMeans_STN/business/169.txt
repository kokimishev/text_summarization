Analysts expect Jet to raise at least 16.4bn rupees ($375m; Â£198m) from the offering. The share offer, representing about 20% of Jet's equity, was oversubscribed, news agency Reuters reported. Jet's IPO is the first in a series of expected share offers from Indian companies this year, as they move to raise funds to help them do business in a rapidly-growing economy. However, it faces stiff competition from rivals and low-cost carriers.
