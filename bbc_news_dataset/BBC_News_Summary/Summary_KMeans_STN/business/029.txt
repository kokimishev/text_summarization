According to Reuters, they plan to seize 12,900 acres (5,200 hectares) from the 32,000 acre (13,000 hectare) farm. The company pointed out that the farm, which employs 300 workers, provides meat solely for the Venezuelan market. Officials claim that Agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. Under President Chavez, the Venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy. The Vestey Group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. "As a consequence the government has taken action." "The legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus," state prosecutor Alexis Ortiz told Reuters.
