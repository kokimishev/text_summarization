In percentage terms, an average of 44% of respondents in each country said the world economy was getting worse, compared to 34% who said it was improving. "People around the world are saying: 'I am OK, but the world is not'."

Almost 23,000 people in 22 countries were questioned for the poll, which was mostly conducted before the Asian tsunami disaster. Pipa conducted the poll from 15 November 2004 to 3 January 2005 across 22 countries in face-to-face or telephone interviews.
