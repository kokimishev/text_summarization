Rising sales of household equipment were behind the increase. According to the INSEE, car sales fell 2.8% in January, following a fall of 0.6% in December. The National Statistic Institute (INSEE) added that consumer spending in January rose 3.8% on a year-on-year basis. "It's a growth that will remain fragile and vulnerable to risks like a strong rise in long-term interest rates, tension in the oil price," Emmanuel Ferry, from Exane BNP Paribas told Reuters news agency. Economic research group ISAE has said that Italian consumer confidence rose to 104.4 from 103.3, despite a slight deterioration in short-term sentiment.
