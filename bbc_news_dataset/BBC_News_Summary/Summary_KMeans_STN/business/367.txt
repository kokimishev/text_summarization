Takeover offer for Sunderland FCBob Murray, chairman of Sunderland FC, has launched a £1.5m ($2.8m) bid for the club after buying broadcaster BSkyB's stake in the business. Should the offer be fully accepted, Mr Murray said he expected to pay a maximum of £1.53m for the remaining shares. Mr Murray said the club would find it easier to attract more investment by having a single majority owner. "The recent speculation surrounding Malcolm Glazer and Manchester United has shown the unsettling effect possible where there are a number of disparate interests," he added. He also stressed that fans who wanted to keep in touch with the club's financial affairs could retain a small number of shares, enabling them to attend annual meetings. Sunderland delisted its shares from the stock market in August.
