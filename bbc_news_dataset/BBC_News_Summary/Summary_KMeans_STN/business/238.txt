A final salary scheme, also known as a defined benefit scheme, promises to pay a pension related to the salary the scheme member is earning when they retire. In 1998/99, for example, contributions rose by 4.7% and in 2002/03 by 8.6%. IDS said there were some schemes in good health. The level of contributions paid by employers has increased gradually since the late 1990s. But, in many cases, firms had been forced to top up funds to tackle "yawning deficits". "We have warned before that the widespread closure of final salary schemes to new entrants is just the beginning of a much bigger movement away from paternalistic provision," said Ms Sudell.
