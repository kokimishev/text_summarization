Golden rule boost for ChancellorChancellor Gordon Brown has been given a Â£2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule, which allows him to borrow only for investment. The extra leeway came after the Office for National Statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. It also said the government might narrowly miss its "golden rule" if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. Mr Letwin said: "This is a very murky area... "Accordingly, it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course." "None of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years," said Jonathan Loynes, chief UK economist at Capital Economics.
