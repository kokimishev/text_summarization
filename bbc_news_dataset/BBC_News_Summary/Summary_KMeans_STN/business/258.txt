S Korea spending boost to economySouth Korea will boost state spending next year in an effort to create jobs and kick start its sputtering economy. The government's main problems are "slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry". In 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said. As a result, South Korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools, hospitals, houses and other public buildings. "The focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the Korean economy in 2005," the ministry said. Not everyone is convinced the plan will work. The government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade.
