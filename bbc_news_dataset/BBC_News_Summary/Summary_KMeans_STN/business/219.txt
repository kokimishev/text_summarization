The club, which has posted record losses and racked up debts, said last week that it was in "a life-threatening profitability and financial situation". It estimated that it needs almost 30m euros ($39m; Â£21m) until the end of June if it is to pay its bills. Borussia officials met with almost all the banks involved in its financing on Friday and over the weekend. On 14 March, one of these creditors - property investment fund Molsiris which owns the club's stadium - holds its AGM at which it will discuss the rescue plan. Borussia Dortmund also is facing calls to appoint executives from outside the club.
