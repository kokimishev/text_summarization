Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said. Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to Â£350m in compensation. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called "magic circle", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
