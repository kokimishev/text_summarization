Hybrids cut both petrol consumption and emissions by combining a petrol engine with an electric motor constantly kept charged by extra engine power. At the Detroit Motor Show, a range of manufacturers are prominently displaying their hybrid credentials. Honda has three hybrids on the market, and between them the two Japanese carmakers sold more than 80,000 units last year. Others remain more sceptical. "We want to make sure we are not concentrating on one technology," Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said. "We will not be surprised by any acceleration or deceleration in the hybrid market." And some watchers point out that the price tag on a hybrid - upwards of $3,000 above that of an equivalent normal-engined car, and suspicion of the technology - may still cool its attraction.
