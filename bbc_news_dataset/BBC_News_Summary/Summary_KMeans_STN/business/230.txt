State-owned Rosneft bought the unit for $9.3bn (Â£5bn) after Yukos was forced to sell assets to meet a $27.5bn tax bill. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. However, Yukos still has an outstanding complaint against Deutsche Bank, which it alleges to be the leader of a consortium that was behind a bid for Yugansk by state gas monopoly Gazprom. Yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by Rosneft. A hearing scheduled for February 16 and 17 will rule on whether the US court has jurisdiction in the case.
