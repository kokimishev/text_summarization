Mr Glazer's financial backers, including JP Morgan, the US investment bank have said they will not back a bid unless it receives backing from the owners of at least 75% of the club's shares. The Sunday Times and The Sunday Telegraph say they will oppose any formal Â£800m takeover bid from US tycoon Malcom Glazer. Mr Glazer got permission to look at the club's accounts last week. Mr Magnier and Mr McManus issued a statement late on Friday saying that they remained "long-term investors" in Man Utd.
