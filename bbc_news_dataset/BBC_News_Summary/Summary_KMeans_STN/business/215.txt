European firms have protested that US laws introduced after the Enron scandal make Wall Street listings too costly. The Act comes into force in mid-2005. Mr Donaldson said that although the Act does not provide exemptions for foreign firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would "continue to be sensitive to the need to accomodate foreign structures and requirements". It obliges all firms with US stock market listings to make declarations, which, critics say, will add substantially to the cost of preparing their annual accounts. But European firms with secondary listings in New York have objected - arguing that the compliance costs outweigh the benefits of a dual listing. A delegation of European firms visited the SEC in December to press for change, the Financial Times reported. Air China picked the London Stock Exchange for its secondary listing in its $1.07bn (Â£558m) stock market debut last month.
