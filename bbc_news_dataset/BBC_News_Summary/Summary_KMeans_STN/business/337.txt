Building giant in asbestos payoutAustralian building products group James Hardie has agreed to pay $1.1bn (Â£568m) to victims of asbestos-related diseases. Campaigners welcomed news of the preliminary agreement. A decision by Hardie to move its headquarters to the Netherlands - while remaining a listed company in Australia - provoked a damaging public outcry. "At the end of the day we are dealing with compensation for people who are terminally ill. We do not know exactly how many of them there will be, we do not know over what exact period they will fall ill," she said. A subsequent New South Wales state inquiry criticised Hardie's actions. In 2001, the company set up a fund to compensate asbestos victims, but it later admitted the fund was running short of money.
