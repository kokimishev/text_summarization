Analysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the US economy. One dollar bought 102.55 yen.

Mr Berlusconi said the euro's strength was "absolutely worrying" for Italian exports. Mr Schroeder said in a newspaper article that stability in foreign exchange markets required a correction of global economic imbalances.
