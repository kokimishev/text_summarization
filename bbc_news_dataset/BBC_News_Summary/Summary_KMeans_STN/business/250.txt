Profits stall at China's LenovoProfits at Chinese computer firm Lenovo have stood still amid slowing demand at home and stiffening competition. But Western firms such as Dell and Hewlett-Packard are also mounting a more solid fight for market share in China, and Lenovo's sales were down 3.7% by revenue to HK$6.31bn. The firm is in the international spotlight after last year signing a deal to buy the PC division of personal computer pioneer IBM. The company is still by far the biggest player in China, with more than a quarter of the market. The reports of the possibility of an investigation into the risk sent Lenovo's shares up 6% in late January.
