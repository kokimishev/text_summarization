Freezing temperatures and heavy snowfalls took crude oil prices past $50 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since November. US crude was trading at $51.39 at 0710 GMT in Asian electronic trade on Wednesday. Although below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in October, prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48. The decline in the US dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. Several Opec members said on Tuesday that a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from Asia. "The primary factor is the weak dollar," said Victor Shum, a Singapore-based analyst with Purvin and Gertz.
