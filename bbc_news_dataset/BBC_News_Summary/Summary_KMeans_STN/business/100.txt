Mr Sullivan "made accounting decisions," he told the federal court, saying his finance chief had "a keen command of the numbers". During his second day of questioning in the New York trial Mr Ebbers played down his working relationship with Mr Sullivan and denied he frequently met him to discuss company business when questioned by the prosecution. Speaking in court, Mr Ebbers rejected allegations he pressured ex-chief financial officer Scott Sullivan to falsify company financial statements. Mr Ebbers has denied charges of fraud and conspiracy. "He's never told me he made an entry that was not right. If he had, we would not be here today."
