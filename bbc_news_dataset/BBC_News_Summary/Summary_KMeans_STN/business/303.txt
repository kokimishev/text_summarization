Earlier, Mr Wilson had said that president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has decided to step in and a decree of some kind of intervention could be signed this week. "In practice, it will be an intervention, although this is not the technical name used", he said. Brazil plays down Varig rescueThe Brazilian government has played down claims that it could step in to save the country's biggest airline. For that to happen Varig's main shareholder, the non-profit Ruben Berta Foundation which represents the airline's employees, would have to be removed, Mr Wilson said. Business has improved recently with demand for air travel increasing and a recovery in the Brazilian economy. An intervention means that the government would take administrative control of the company and its finances.
