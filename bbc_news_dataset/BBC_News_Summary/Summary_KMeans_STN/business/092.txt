Iranian MPs threaten mobile dealTurkey's biggest private mobile firm could bail out of a $3bn ($1.6bn) deal to build a network in Iran after MPs there slashed its stake in the project. The new operator planned to offer subscriptions for about $180, well below the existing firm's $500 price tag. They say that Turkcell is a security risk because of alleged business ties with Israel. Telecoms is one of two areas specifically targeted by the new veto law on foreign investments, passed earlier in September. "If management control and financial consolidation of Irancell cannot be achieved... the realisation of the project will become risky," it warned in a statement. The two countries strengthened ties in both defence and economic issues in 2004.
