GM's plans to build the American marque in Sweden is part of its efforts to push it as an alternative luxury brand for European drivers. They may now have to face a larger proportion of GM's cuts. The segment's leaders do not agree. Other luxury car makers, most notably the Toyota subsidiary Lexus, have enjoyed tremendous success in the US without managing to make significant inroads in Europe. Another way to further reduce Saab's losses could be to shift some of the production of Saabs to the US, a market where drivers have adopted it as an upmarket European car. It is to deploy a fleet of 35,000 test cars across 40 countries, inviting potential buyers to try out a vehicle for 24-hours. It follows a similar initiative by GM in the US. "We know that in five years the US dollar will be stronger than it is today," the chief executive of a leading European car maker told BBC News.
