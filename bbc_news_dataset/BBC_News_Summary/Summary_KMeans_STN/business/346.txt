Swiss Re has said total claims are likely to be less than $10bn (Â£5.17bn). Rebuilding costs are likely to be cheaper than in developed countries, and many of those affected will not have insurance, analysts said. Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world's two biggest reinsurers, have said exposure will be less than for other disasters. However, it said the tidal waves were unlikely to have a "significant" impact on its business. A spokeswoman for Hanover Re, Europe's fifth-largest reinsurance firm, estimated tsunami-related damage claims would be in the low double-digit millions of euros. Most US insurers have relatively little exposure to Asia and those that do, pass on a lot of the risk to reinsurance companies or special catastrophe funds. "You need very complicated processes to estimate damages. It's more likely the Bermuda-based reinsurance [companies] might have some exposure," said Paul Newsome, an insurance analyst at AG Edwards & Co. Mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998.
