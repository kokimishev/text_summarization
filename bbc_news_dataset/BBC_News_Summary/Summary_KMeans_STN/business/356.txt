The government has set an economic growth rate target of 5% for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action. The government's main problems are "slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry". In 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said. The government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade. "The focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the Korean economy in 2005," the ministry said. As a result, South Korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools, hospitals, houses and other public buildings. It also will look at real estate tax system.
