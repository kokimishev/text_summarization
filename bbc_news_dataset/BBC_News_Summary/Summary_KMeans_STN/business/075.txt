Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting. It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the "competitiveness of the airlines". At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states. The world's richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015.
