As well as strong domestic demand, exports climbed by 1.3% in the fourth quarter - the biggest increase in foreign sales for a year. Analysts warned that France still was facing challenges and was unlikely to keep expanding at its current pace.

"But we expect overall economic growth to fall to 2.0 percent in 2005." Here it gets contributions from investment and exports, though household consumption is still strong.
