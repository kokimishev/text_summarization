Mr Sullivan has spent two days being cross-examined by lawyers for former Worldcom chief executive Mr Ebbers. "At that point in time," Mr Sullivan said, referring to the first false entries in late 2000, "I knew it was wrong and I knew it was against the law, but I thought we would get through it in the short term." He pleads not guilty. Scott Sullivan admitted to jurors he was willing to commit fraud to meet Wall Street earnings projections. Mr Ebbers, 63, has always insisted that he was unaware of any hidden shortfalls in WorldCom's finances. WorldCom's problems appear to have begun with the collapse of the dotcom boom which cut its business from internet companies.
