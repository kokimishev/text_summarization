Mr Marchionne becomes the fourth head of the business - which is expected to make a 800m euro ($1bn) loss in 2004 - in as many years. The management changes are part of a wider shake-up of the business following Fiat's resolution of its dispute with General Motors. Sales are expected to fall in 2005, Fiat said this week, as it exits unprofitable areas such as the rental car market. "I have made the decision to take on the post of chief executive of the auto unit to speed up the company's recovery," he said. Mr Demel, a car industry veteran, took the helm in November 2003 after being recruited by former Fiat chief executive Giuseppe Morchio. Earlier this week, Fiat reached an agreement with GM to dissolve an alliance which could have obliged GM to buy the Italian firm outright. GM will pay Fiat $2bn as part of the settlement.
