The Indian-born magnate did not say where the job losses would fall. It employs 50,000 staff in Kazakhstan alone, and has large operations in Romania, the Czech Republic, South Africa and the United States. A combination of Mittal Steel and ISG would have annual sales of $32bn (Â£16.7bn; 24.1bn euros) and a production capacity of 70 million tonnes. "We are investing in modernisation so employees will go down," Mr Mittal told the conference in Chicago. Mittal Steel has operations in 14 countries.
