French boss to leave EADSThe French co-head of European defence and aerospace group EADS Philippe Camus is to leave his post. "I will give up my role as soon as the board of directors asks me to do so," he said. The other main shareholders of EADS are the French government (15%) , who also support Mr Forgeard, and Germany's DaimlerChrysler (30%). But Mr Forgeard has denied this, telling French media that there is no current overrun in the budget. EADS - Airbus' majority owner - admitted earlier this week that the project was running 1.45bn euros (Â£1bn; $1.9bn) over budget.
