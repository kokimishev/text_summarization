The deal would create the world's biggest bank with assets of about 189 trillion yen ($1.8 trillion). Sumitomo, Japan's third-largest bank, tabled a higher offer for UFJ than its rival, valuing the company at $35bn. Sumitomo's exit ends the most high profile fight in Japanese bank history. "Given the ongoing integration of UFJ and MTFG operations, persisting with our proposal may not be in the best interests of our shareholders or UFJ's." However, this is expected to be a formality. The two are set to merge their venture capital operations and there has been speculation that this could lead to a full-blown merger.
