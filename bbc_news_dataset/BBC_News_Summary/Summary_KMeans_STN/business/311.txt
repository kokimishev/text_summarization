"2004 reinforces the trend towards higher losses," said Swiss Re. Some 95% of insurance claims were for natural catastrophes, with the rest attributed to made-made events. The world's second biggest insurer said disasters around the globe have seen property claims reach $42bn (£21.5bn). Swiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters around the world in 2004.
