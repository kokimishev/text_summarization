The sale of the US gaming unit will leave Wembley with its UK business. BLB holds a 22% stake in Wembley and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a Â£308m takeover deal. Wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its US gaming division to BLB Investors. Shares in Wembley were up 56 pence, or 7.6%, at 797p by mid-morning. "Whilst the completion of the sale of the US Gaming Division remains subject to a number of conditions, we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders," said Wembley chairman Claes Hultman.
