Axa Sun Life cuts bonus paymentsLife insurer Axa Sun Life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors. The rest will know their fate in March. However, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies. The cut will hit an estimated 3% of Axa's policyholders. "The stock market has grown over the past 18 months, however not enough to undo the damage that occurred during 2001 and 2002," Axa spokesman Mark Hamilton, Axa spokesman, told BBC News.
