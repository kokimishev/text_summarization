The world's biggest retailer Wal-Mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers. "There are lots of 'urban legends' going around these days about Wal-Mart, but facts are facts. In the averts, entitled An Open Letter from chief executive Sidney Taurel, the company says the article continues to "needlessly spread fear among patients who take Prozac". In California, the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. Meanwhile Eli Lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers, to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug Prozac. Wal-Mart is good for consumers, good for communities and good for the US economy," Mr Scott said in a separate statement. Eli Lilly's chief medical officer Alan Breier said that the article was "false and misleading" as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and presented to an FDA meeting in 1991.
