The economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the July to September period, the Commerce Department said. Friday's growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 November presidential election. "It's a pretty good growth rate, but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs," said Robert Brusca, chief economist at Fact and Opinion Economics in New York. In an effort to pre-empt rising inflation, the Federal Reserve has pushed through three quarter-point rate rises since June this year, taking borrowing costs to 1.75%. "I think that means the Fed can take its time raising rates. We'll probably see one more rate hike before the end of the year."
