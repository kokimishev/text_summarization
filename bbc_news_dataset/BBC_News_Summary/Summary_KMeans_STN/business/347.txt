The value of trade in April-July rose to $186.3m (Â£97m) from $64.4m in the same period in 2003, the Indian Government said. Both countries eased travel and other restrictions as part of the peace process aimed at ending nearly six decades of hostilities. Nonethless, the figures represent less than 1% of India's overall exports.

Higher oil prices, the level of tax collections, and an unfavourable monsoon season affecting the farm sector had hurt the economy in April-September, it said.
