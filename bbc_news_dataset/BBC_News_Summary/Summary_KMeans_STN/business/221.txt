BP surges ahead on high oil priceOil giant BP has announced a 26% rise in annual profits to $16.2bn (Â£8.7bn) on the back of record oil prices. Despite the record annual profits figure, BP's performance was below the expectations of some City analysts. The company is earning about $1.8m an hour. Currently above $40 a barrel, he said: "The price of oil will be well supported above $30 a barrel for the medium term." "We have spent many years buying (assets) when the price is low," he said. Lord Browne pointed out that BP was reaping the benefits of its investment in oil exploration.
