Khodorkovsky quits Yukos sharesJailed tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky has transferred his controlling stake in oil giant Yukos to a business partner. "It is all over. "Since the sale of Yuganskneftegaz, I have been delivered of (all) responsibility for the business that remains and the group's money as a whole," Mr Khodorkovsky said. It was sold by the Russian authorities to recover government tax claims against Yukos totalling over $27bn. However, the charges are widely seen as politically motivated and part of a drive by Russian President Vladimir Putin to rein in the country's super-rich business leaders, the so-called oligarchs.
