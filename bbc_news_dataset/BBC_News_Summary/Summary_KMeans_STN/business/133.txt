Salary scandal in CameroonCameroon says widespread corruption in its finance ministry has cost it 1bn CFA francs ($2m; Â£1m) a month. The government now intends to carry out an audit of payrolls at all other government ministries. Fidelis Nanga, a journalist based in the Cameroon capital Yaounde, said the government was considering taking criminal action against those found guilty and forcing them to repay any money owed. Mr Inoni launched an anti-corruption drive in December after foreign investors criticised a lack of transparency in the country's public finances. In a report compiled by anti-corruption body Transparency International in 2003, graft was said to be "pervasive" in Cameroon.
