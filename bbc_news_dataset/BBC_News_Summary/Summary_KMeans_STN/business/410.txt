A switch to new models hit luxury marque Mercedes-Benz, with sales down 3.1% at 1.06 million. Sales totalled 3.9 million units worldwide during 2004, the company said at the Detroit Motor Show. The future of the brand - which is controlled by the Mercedes group within DaimlerChrysler - remains in question, however. Smart has consistently lost money since it started trading in 1998, and new model launches are now "on hold", said Mercedes chief executive Eckhard Cordes.
