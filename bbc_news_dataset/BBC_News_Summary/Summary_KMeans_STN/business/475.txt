Watchdog probes Vivendi bond saleFrench stock market regulator AMF has filed complaints against media giant Vivendi Universal, its boss and another top executive. Both men bought some of the bonds, the Associated Press news agency reported. AMF is investigating claims that the duo were aware of an interest in Vivendi's US assets from investor Marvin Davis, at the time of the bond sale. The watchdog is said to believe the executive pair were party to "privileged information" surrounding the issue of the bonds. Vivendi advisor Deutsche Bank was also the subject of a complaint filing.
