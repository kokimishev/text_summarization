UK young top Euro earnings leagueBritish children enjoy the highest average annual income in Europe - more than double that of Spanish or Italian youngsters, a report suggests. Datamonitor adds that British teenagers are keen on personal care because it helps them combine two seemingly contradictory emotional needs - the desire to fit in and the desire to express their individuality. They use "pester power" to get their parents to stump up nearly a third of this income, the report said. Nearly three out of four girls said they used make-up.
