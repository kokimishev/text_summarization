Policy makers in Europe have called the dollar's slide "brutal" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. But analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the US economy were still significant. They also pointed out that positive comments apart, President George W Bush's administration had done little to stop the dollar's slide. The current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. "Our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values," he explained. Some analysts maintain the US is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in Europe, thus boosting its economy. "It is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30."
