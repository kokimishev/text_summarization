But officials said stagnant growth was still stifling the job market. With unemployment stuck above 4 million for years, the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has put job creation at the top of the agenda. "There are clear signs of a revival in domestic demand," said Frank-Juergen Weise, head of the Federal Labour Agency, in a statement. The scheme's formal launch is January, but hirings for these positions are already taking place and affecting the unemployment statistics, economists said. "But growth of 0.1%... in the third quarter is still insufficient to deliver positive momentum to the labour market." Among the new initiatives are the so-called "one-euro jobs" which top up unemployment benefit.
