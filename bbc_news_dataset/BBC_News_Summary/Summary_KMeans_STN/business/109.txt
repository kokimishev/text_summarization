The board of Lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. Lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the Iraq war and the killer SARS virus. In 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. The company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 March.
