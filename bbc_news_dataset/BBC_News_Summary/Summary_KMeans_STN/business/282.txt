The Xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. Chinese dam firm 'defies Beijing'The China Three Gorges Project Corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the Chinese state press has said. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6% to 440,700 megawatts (MW). Previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages, which forced many factories into part-time working last year. "The Three Gorges Corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law," it said.
