EMI shares hit by profit warningShares in music giant EMI have sunk by more than 16% after the firm issued a profit warning following disappointing sales and delays to two album releases. By 1200 GMT on Monday, EMI shares were down 16.2% at 235.75 pence. "Therefore, for the full year, at constant currency, EMI Music's sales are now expected to be 8% to 9% lower than the prior year." Alain Levy, chairman and chief executive of EMI Music, described the performance as "disappointing", but added that he remained optimistic over future trends in the industry. "The physical music market is showing signs of stabilisation in many parts of the world and digital music, in all its forms, continues to develop at a rapid pace," he said.
