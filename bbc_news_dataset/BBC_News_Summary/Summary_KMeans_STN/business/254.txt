According to the Financial Times, chief operating officer Peter Chernin said that News Corp is "kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies". Video games are "big business", the paper quoted Mr Chernin as saying. Today, games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. France's Ubisoft, one of Europe's biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since Electronic Arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm. Analysts have said that industry mergers are likely in the future. "These may be too focused on one or two product lines."
