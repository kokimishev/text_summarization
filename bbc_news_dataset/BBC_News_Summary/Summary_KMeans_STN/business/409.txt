Standard Chartered said acquiring Korea First Bank (KFB) fulfilled a strategic objective of building a bigger presence in Asia's third largest economy. Standard Chartered expects about 16% of future group revenue to come from KFB. South Korea's economy is expected to grow by 4.5% this year. In London, Standard Chartered's sale of 118 million new shares to institutional investors pushed its share price down, and contributing to the FTSE 100's 0.3% decline. "We're comfortable with the price paid...the key here has been speed and decisiveness in making sure that we won," said Standard Chartered chief executive Mervyn Davies at a London press conference. The South Korean government owns 51.4% of KFB, while the remaining shareholding, and operational control, are in the hands of US private equity group Newbridge Capital. Standard Chartered sees "the opportunity to create value by the introduction of more sophisticated banking products". Although often thought of an export-driven economy, South Korea's service sector has overtaken manufacturing in the last decade or so.
