The US firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (Â£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. Reports of deadlocked talks sent Fiat shares down 1.2% on Tuesday, after Monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. For its part, GM's European units Opel and Saab have both had trouble, with Opel management threatening to cut 12,000 jobs. The German firm wanted to buy Fiat outright. But Gianni Agnelli, the godfather of the group, wanted to keep control, and preferred GM's offer to buy a 20% stake and give Fiat the right to sell in the future, known as a "put option".
