Delta cuts fares in survival planDelta Air Lines is cutting domestic fares by as much as 50% as part of a plan to ensure its financial survival. It is also eliminating a Saturday-night stay requirement on discount fares and will give further reductions to customers opting for non-refundable tickets, booking in advance and online. Delta's new SimpliFares were trialled from August last year on tickets from Cincinnati, its second-largest hub. Other US carriers, including United, have sought bankruptcy protection, amid high fuel costs and competition from discount carriers. "We believe the whole airline industry will now have to move in this direction; this will likely hurt revenue in the short run but could be beneficial in the long run," said analyst Ray Neidl at Calyon Securities.
