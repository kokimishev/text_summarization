Moreover, government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. The tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (Â£10.8bn) in three years. As part of a charm offensive - ahead of 17 December, when the European Union will decide whether to start entry talks - Turkey's economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. Turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in "Old Europe" once its population comes of age. However, Turkey's assertions are confirmed by Brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy.

But economics is not a science.
