Yukos accused of lying to courtRussian oil firm Yukos lied to a US court in an attempt to stop the Russian government selling off its key production unit, the court has heard. But he said that the papers documenting the transaction were not drawn up till weeks after Yukos made its bankruptcy application on 14 December, and then backdated. Deutsche Bank is involved in the case because it is itself being sued by Yukos. "It gives us a kind of life after death alternative," said Yukos chief executive Steven Theede. Rosneft, meanwhile, has agreed to merge with Gazprom, bringing a large chunk of Russia's very profitable oil business back under state control.
