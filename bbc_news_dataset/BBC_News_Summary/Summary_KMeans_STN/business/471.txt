Tsunami slows Sri Lanka's growthSri Lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (Â£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. "We are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. "The fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term," the report said. Mrs Kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be "the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation". Economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast.
