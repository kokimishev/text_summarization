Analysts warned that it was still too early to draw too many conclusions from this new set of proposals. Observers said that the move may represent a shift in policy, as the administration of Vladimir Putin puts the protection of national interests above free market dynamics. Company spokesman Glenn Waller said Exxon still considered the deal valid, despite Russia inviting new offers for the land block. "It's not good. "We regret the ministry has taken such a decision," said Ivan Kulakov, deputy chairman of Highland Gold - a mining firm that has the motto "Bringing Russia's Gold to Market". Exxon, the world's largest oil company, has signed preliminary agreements to develop the Sakhalin 3 field. "It would be a shame if that has a negative impact on the investment climate."
