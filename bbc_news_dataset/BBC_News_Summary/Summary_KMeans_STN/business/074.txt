Turkish-Austrian consortium TAV was chosen to build and run Tehran's new Imam Khomeini International Airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in May 2004. Turkcell said the decision "increases the risks" attached to the project. If Turkcell does back out, MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal. The move, which was justified on national security grounds, follows an earlier vote by MPs to give themselves a veto over foreign investments.
