BMW drives record sales in AsiaBMW has forecast sales growth of at least 10% in Asia this year after registering record sales there in 2004. BMW sold nearly 95,000 cars in Asia last year, up 2.6% on 2003. However, BMW is hopeful of a much better year in 2005 as its direct investment in China begins to pay dividends. The company only began assembling luxury high-powered sedans in China in 2003. "Here in Asia, we consider a double-digit increase in retail on the order of 10 to 15% to be realistic on the basis of current features," said Helmut Panke, BMW's group chief executive.
