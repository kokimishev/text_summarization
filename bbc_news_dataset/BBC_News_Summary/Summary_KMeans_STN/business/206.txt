It is the sixth time in three years Standard Life has made cuts to bonus rates, despite an 8.7% rise in the value of the with-profits fund in 2004. Annual bonus rates on its with-profits life policies were cut from 2.5% to 2%, while bonuses on pension policies were reduced from 3.25% to 2.5%. The insurer argued that shares outperformed other investments over the long term and that policyholders would feel the benefit when the stock market recovered. With-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. "Our payouts continue to stand up well against other types of long-term investments over similar periods," he said. Recently, Norwich Union and Axa Sun Life both cut their with-profit bonus rates.
