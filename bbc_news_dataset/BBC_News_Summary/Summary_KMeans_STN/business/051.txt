That sale valued Ferrari - which owns the Maserati brand - at 2.3bn euros. Fiat mulls Ferrari market listingFerrari could be listed on the stock market as part of an overhaul of Fiat's carmaking operations, the Financial Times has reported. It considered floating Ferrari in 2002 but opted to sell a minority stake to Italian bank Mediobanca for 775m euros ($1bn). The price tag would change if Maserati was stripped out. Such a move would help Alfa Romeo and Maserati to share marketing, distribution and research & development costs. The Financial Times said Fiat may transfer Maserati within its wholly- owned Alfa Romeo division in an effort to exploit commercial synergies.
