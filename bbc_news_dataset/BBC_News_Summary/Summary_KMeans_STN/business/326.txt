The financial regulator said Fannie Mae would have to raise substantial new capital to restore its balance sheet. Mr Raines, head of the Office of Management and Budget under President Clinton, has taken early retirement while Mr Howard has also stepped down, the company said on Tuesday. Although not making loans directly to buyers, Fannie Mae is the largest single player in the mortgage market, underwriting half of all US house purchases. The problems afflicting Fannie Mae are just the latest to hit the US mortgage industry. As a result, it could be forced to restate $9bn in earnings over the past four years, effectively wiping out a third of the company's profits since 2001. "By my early retirement, I have held myself accountable," Mr Raines said in a statement.
