US firms created 337,000 jobs last month, twice the amount expected, while exports reached record levels in September. The Fed did not rule out raising rates once again in December but noted that any future increases would take place at a "measured" pace. Analysts claimed the Fed's assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in December. The Central Bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth. The Bank of England (BoE) has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months, leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked. The Dow Jones Industrial average closed down 0.89 points, or 0.01%, at 10,385.48. "Let's wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarter's energy price drag before concluding that the Fed has more work to do in 2005," said Avery Shenfeld, senior economist at CIBC World Markets.
