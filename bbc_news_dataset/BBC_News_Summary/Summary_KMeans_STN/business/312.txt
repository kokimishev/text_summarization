Parmalat sues 45 banks over crashParmalat has sued 45 banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit Italian dairy company went bust last year. The unidentified Parmalat source also told Reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions. It has also gone after auditors Grant Thornton. Among those already targeted are Bank of America, UBS, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank and Citigroup. Parmalat was declared insolvent in December 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist.
