The deal will see Novartis' Sandoz business overtake Israel's Teva Pharmaceuticals as the world's biggest maker of generics. Novartis said that it would merge a number of departments, adding that there may be job cuts. Based on 2004 figures the newly merged producer would have sales of more than $5bn, the company estimated. There are more than 150 generic drugmakers worldwide and analysts have predicted consolidation in a market that they call fragmented. "This is a very expensive acquisition," Birgit Kuhlhoff, from Sal Oppenheim investment bank, told Reuters. "I find it strange that they are making acquisitions in exactly those markets where they suffered price pressure."
