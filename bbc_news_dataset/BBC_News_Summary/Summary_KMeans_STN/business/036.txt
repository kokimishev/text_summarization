US gives foreign firms extra timeForeign firms have been given an extra year to meet tough new corporate governance regulations imposed by the US stock market watchdog. The SEC said it had taken into consideration the fact that foreign companies were already working to meet more onerous financial reporting rules in their home countries. Section 404 of the Sox Act, as the legislation is nicknamed, calls for all firms to certify that their financial reporting is in line with US rules. "They have been listening to us and to many overseas companies, who have reminded America what globalisation really means: that they cannot make these rules in isolation." "I think this signifies a change of heart at the SEC," CBI director-general Sir Digby Jones told the BBC's Today programme.
