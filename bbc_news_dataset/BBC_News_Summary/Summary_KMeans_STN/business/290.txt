The BRC said Britain's retailers had endured their worst Christmas in a decade. "But, if there are clear signs that the economy slows, the MPC should be ready to take quick corrective action and cut rates. On Thursday there was more gloomy news on the manufacturing front, as the Office for National (ONS) statistics revealed British manufacturing output unexpectedly fell in November - for the fifth month in the past six. Rising interest rates and the accompanying slowdown in the housing market have knocked consumers' optimism, causing a sharp fall in demand for expensive goods, according to a report earlier this week from the British Retail Consortium. "So far the evidence suggests that last year's rate increases have helped to rebalance the economy without damaging the recovery in manufacturing," said EEF chief economist, Steve Radley. "It is widely accepted that, if house prices start falling more sharply, the risks facing the economy will worsen considerably." It also said there was evidence that manufacturers' confidence may be waning as the outlook for the world economy becomes more uncertain.
