While the US economy is growing at a "reasonably good pace" he warned that budget concerns were clouding the economic outlook for the US. "I fear that we may have already committed more physical resources to the baby-boom generation in its retirement years than our economy has the capacity to deliver. Meanwhile any move to narrow the deficit gap by raising taxes could pose a significant risk to the economy by dampening growth and spending, he added. Speaking to the House Budget Committee he urged Congress to take action to cut the deficit, such as increasing taxes. Since President George W Bush came to office the federal budget has swung from a record surplus to a record deficit of $412bn last year. As US growth gathers steam and incomes rise that should lead to a narrowing of the deficit.
