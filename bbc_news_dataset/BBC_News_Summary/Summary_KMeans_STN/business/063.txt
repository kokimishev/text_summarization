The 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected, coming after December's 4% rise in car sales, fuelled by generous pre-Christmas special offers. These strong gains were in part put down to consumers spending gift vouchers they had been given for Christmas. Sales at restaurants, bars and coffee houses rose by 0.3%, while grocery store sales were up 0.5%. "We are not seeing the numbers that we saw in the second half of 2004, but they are still pretty healthy," he added. Steve Gallagher, US chief economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said January's figures were "decent numbers". Parul Jain, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005, only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004.
