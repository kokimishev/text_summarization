US economy still growing says FedMost areas of the US saw their economy continue to expand in December and early January, the US Federal Reserve said in its latest Beige Book report. "Labour markets firmed in a number of districts, but wage pressures generally remained modest," the Beige Book said. "Several districts reported higher prices for building materials and manufacturing inputs, but most reported steady or only slightly higher overall price levels." The report added that residential real estate activity remained strong and that commercial real estate activity strengthened in most districts.
