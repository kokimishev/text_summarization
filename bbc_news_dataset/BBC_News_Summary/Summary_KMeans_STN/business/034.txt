But Rover told BBC News that reports of job cuts were "speculation". Meanwhile, according to Chinese state press reports, small state-owned carmaker Nanjing Auto is in negotiations with Rover and SAIC to take a 20% stake in the joint venture. Rover bosses have said they are "confident" the Â£1bn ($1.9bn) investment deal would be signed in March or early April. "SAIC is extremely concerned to ensure that its money is used to invest in the business rather than be distributed to the shareholders," the newspaper quotes a source close to the Chinese firm. SAIC was unavailable for comment on the job cuts when contacted by BBC News.
