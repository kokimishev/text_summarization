BT offers equal access to rivalsBT has moved to pre-empt a possible break-up of its business by offering to cut wholesale broadband prices and open its network to rivals. The company also unveiled plans to cut the wholesale prices of its most popular broadband product by about 8% from April in areas of high customer demand. BT wants lighter regulation in exchange for the changes, as well as the removal of the break-up threat. The move comes after telecom regulator Ofcom said in November that the firm must offer competitors "real equality of access to its phone lines". To meet the growing demand for greater bandwidth, BT said it would begin trials in April with a view to launching higher-speed services nationally from the autumn. "The United Kingdom has the opportunity to create the most exciting and innovative telecoms market in the world," BT chief executive Ben Verwaayen said. "BT has been challenged to play fair and its plans will introduce a level playing field. More than 100 telecom firms, consumer groups and other interested parties are expected to make submissions to the regulator during this consultation phase.
