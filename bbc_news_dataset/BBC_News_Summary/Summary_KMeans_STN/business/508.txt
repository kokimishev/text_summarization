Prosecutors said he was motivated by wealth - spending about $200m between 1996 and 2002 while earning much less. "We will present evidence that Richard Scrushy knew about the conspiracy, that he participated in the conspiracy and that he profited," prosecutor Alice Martin told the court. After federal agents raided HealthSouth's offices in March 2003, the company said none of its past financial statements could be relied on. Several former HealthSouth employees have already pleaded guilty to fraud and are expected to give evidence against Mr Scrushy.
