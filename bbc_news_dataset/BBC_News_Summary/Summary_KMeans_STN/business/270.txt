The price of crude is still up about 30% on the start of 2004, but has fallen from the record of $55.67 set in late October. The long-awaited drop in oil prices helped to ease persistent investor jitters over the impact of energy costs on company profits and economic growth. However, traders warned that the fall could be short-lived if there is a cold snap in North America this winter or any major supply problems in other parts of the world. "It's amazing how quickly sentiment changed," said Rick Mueller, an analyst at Energy Security Analysis. However, some analysts believe the sharp fall in crude prices may harden Opec's attitude to over-production, leading to a scaling back of oil output. "Long term I think we are headed to $30-35 but I do not think we are doing that yet. We have a lot of winter left." .
