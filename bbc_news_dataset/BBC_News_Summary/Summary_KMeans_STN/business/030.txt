However, the Paris-based economics think tank said it believed the global economy could still regain momentum. But the outlook was worst for the 12-member eurozone bloc, with already sluggish growth forecasts slipping to 1.8% from 2.0% this year and 1.9% from 2.4% in 2005, the OECD said. In its latest bi-annual report, the OECD cut its growth predictions for the world's main industrialised regions. "The oil shock is not enormous by historical standards - we have seen worse in the seventies. "There are nonetheless good reasons to believe that despite recent oil price turbulence the world economy will regain momentum in a not-too-distant future," said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the OECD's chief economist. "The recovery that was underway, and has been interrupted a bit by the oil shock this year, would then regain momentum in the course of 2005."
