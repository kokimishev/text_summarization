South African car demand surgesCar manufacturers with plants in South Africa, including BMW, General Motors, Toyota and Volkswagen, have seen a surge in demand during 2004. During 2004 "South Africa was one of the best performing markets internationally" for car sales, NAAMSA said. NAAMSA said it expects sales to top 500,000 in 2005. However, the world auto market has its problems and analysts warn that overcapacity and the strength of the rand could hit exports.
