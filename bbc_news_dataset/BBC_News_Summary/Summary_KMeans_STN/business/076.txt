Unemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against Israeli occupation four years ago. The closures arranged by Israel restrict the movement of Palestinian people and goods, slowing down trade. But 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. "Closures are a key factor behind today's economic crisis in the West Bank," said Nigel Roberts, World Bank country director for the West Bank and Gaza. Nearly half of all Palestinians - some 47% - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks.
