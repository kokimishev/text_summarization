Despite struggling since it was opened in 1992, EuroDisney has recently made progress in turning its business around and ticket sales have picked up. The US Disney Corporation and Saudi Arabian prince Al-Walid bin Talal, the firm's two main shareholders, will buy the new stock. The company's currently traded stock tumbled in Paris on the latest news, shedding 15% to 22 euro cents. The sale is the last part of a plan to restructure 2.4bn euros-worth of debts.
