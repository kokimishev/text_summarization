Meanwhile, the economy is expanding at a healthy rate, with 7.9% growth expected in 2004. The government hopes the change will be seen as a promise of growing economic stability as Turkey embarks on the long process of trying to join the European Union. The Turkish economy teetered on the brink of collapse in 2001 when the lira plunged in value and two million people lost their jobs. These tough measures have borne fruit. Inflation fell below 10% earlier this year for the first time in decades while exports are up 30% this year. "The Turkish lira has been like funny money," Tevfik Aksoy, chief Turkish economist for Deutsche Bank, told Associated Press. "This will definitely affect people psychologically."
