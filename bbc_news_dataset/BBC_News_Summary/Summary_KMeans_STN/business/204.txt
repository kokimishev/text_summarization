Vice-President Dick Cheney said the budget was the "tightest" so far. About 150 federal programs could be cut or axed altogether as part of a $2.5 trillion (Â£1.3 trillion) package aimed at curbing the giant US budget deficit. Despite the Republicans holding a majority in both houses of Congress, the proposals will be fiercely contested over the next few months. Most controversially, the government is seeking to cut the Medicaid budget, which provides health care to the nation's poorest, by $45bn and to reduce farm subsidies by $587m. The shortfall is projected to rise to $427bn in 2005. However, Democratic Senator Kent Conrad said the proposals exposed the country to huge financial commitments beyond 2009. "With the deficits that we are now running, I am glad the president is coming over with a very austere budget," he said.
