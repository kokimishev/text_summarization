Nearly 9,000 business leaders in 104 countries were surveyed for Business and HIV/AIDS: Commitment and Action? One company that does have a plan is Anglo-American, the international mining company, which estimates an HIV prevalence of 24% among its 130,000-strong Southern African workforce. Nor could over 65% of the business leaders surveyed say or estimate the prevalence of HIV among their staff. "Companies should encourage all workers to know their HIV status, making it as routine as monitoring blood pressure or cholesterol," he said. A key priority, in both high and low-prevalence settings, said the WEF is to establish a policy based on non-discrimination and confidentiality. "Too few companies are responding proactively to the social and business threats," said Dr Kate Taylor, head of the WEF's global Health Initiative. Most (71%) have no policies in place to address the disease.
