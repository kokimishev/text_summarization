The outlook for the service sector was "uncertain" despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter, the BCC noted. Manufacturers' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter, the survey of 5,196 firms found. The Bank of England raised interest rates five times between November 2003 and August last year. But rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output. "Despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying signs for manufacturing," the BCC said. "While consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months, it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack."
