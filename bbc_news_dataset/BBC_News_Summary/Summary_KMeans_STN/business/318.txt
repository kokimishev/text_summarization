A US judge banned Gazprom from taking part in the auction and barred international banks from providing the firm with cash. "Yuganskneftegas has been sold in the best traditions of the 90s. "They screwed up the financing," said Ronald Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital in Moscow. The sale has however bought time for Gazprom to raise the money needed for the purchase, analysts said. Yukos claims that it is being punished for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is now in jail facing separate fraud charges. "We tried to find it, but we could not and as far as I know, the papers had the same result." Yukos is not planning on letting go of its unit without a fight and has threatened legal action against any buyer.
