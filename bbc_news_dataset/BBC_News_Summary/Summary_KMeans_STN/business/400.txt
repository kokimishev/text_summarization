Despite the bribe, the official did not authorise the waiving of the environmental study requirement. Monsanto was facing stiff opposition from activists and farmers who were campaigning against its plans to introduce genetically-modified cotton in Indonesia. A former senior manager at Monsanto directed an Indonesian consulting firm to give a $50,000 bribe to a high-level official in Indonesia's environment ministry in 2002. Monsanto also has admitted to paying bribes to a number of other high-ranking officials between 1997 and 2002. Monsanto said it accepted full responsibility for its employees' actions, adding that it had taken "remedial actions to address the activities in Indonesia" and had been "fully co-operative" throughout the investigative process. "Companies cannot bribe their way into favourable treatment by foreign officials," said Christopher Wray, assistant US attorney general.
