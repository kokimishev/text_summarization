Asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt. Japan turns to beer alternativesJapanese brewers are increasingly making money from beer-flavoured drinks rather than beer itselfBeer and spirits are heavily taxed in Japan, driving breweries to search for alternatives. Kirin, the fourth big name, is launching its own "third-type" drink in April. Suntory, meanwhile, is doing well with "Super Blue", which combines happoshu - an existing low-cost beer alternative made with malt and seawater - and shochu, a distilled alcohol derived from sweet potatoes or barley.
