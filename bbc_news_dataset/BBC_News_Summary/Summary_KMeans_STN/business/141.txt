Speaking at a BMW event ahead of the Geneva motor show, Helmut Panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in Europe. "We have decided that the BMW brand will enter the segment," he said. Typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets, Mr Panke said, implying that a BMW crossover could be on the market by 2008. A decision on just how BMW will manage its entry into the new market is due in the first half of 2005. "We are going to go that way."
