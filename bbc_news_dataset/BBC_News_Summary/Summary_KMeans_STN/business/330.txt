The country's economy is set to grow about 8% this year after seeing 9% growth last year, a sharp turnaround from 2002 when output fell 11%. Argentina was on the brink of collapse. Argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors. True, problems remain, but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. Mr Valentine, who was born in the United States but grew up in Argentina, was fortunate: At the time of the crisis, his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad. This is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits. With the international negotiations being troubled, it is of little help to President Kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well. "Locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now," he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re-opening. "Agriculture and tourism are helping," said entrepreneur Drayton Valentine. "People have to deposit their money in the banks, not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses."
