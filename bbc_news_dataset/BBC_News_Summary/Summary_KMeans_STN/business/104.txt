US seeks new $280bn smoker rulingThe US Justice Department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (Â£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms. "It's pretty clear that they have suffered a severe setback," said Anthony Sebok, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, adding that the appeal was what the government "would be expected to ask for". Central to the government's case was a meeting in the Plaza Hotel, New York, on 15 December, 1953. Government lawyers have until 21 March to file their appeal. The tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. Altria's Philip Morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful, and the company's main lawyer William Ohlemeyer told the BBC last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest.
