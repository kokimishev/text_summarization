Southcorp's shares rose 12% to A$4.76 on news of the offer but Foster's shares fell 3.7% to A$5.44. However, it said that the offer may represent an 'opening bid', opening up the possibility of Foster's returning with an improved offer. Southcorp said Foster's A$4.17-a-share takeover proposal offered a "excellent strategic fit" but undervalued the company. "Southcorp's board has informed Foster's that it is not prepared to recommend the offer as it does not adequately reflect the strategic value of the company," said Southcorp chairman Brian Finn. The two companies held four days of talks after Foster's bought an 18.8% stake in Southcorp on 13 January.
