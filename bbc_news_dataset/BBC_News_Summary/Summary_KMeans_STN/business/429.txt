The US imported almost $20bn worth of goods from China during October, exporting a little under $3bn. "We are seeing improved export orders. Things seem to be going in the right direction." "It seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains," said Anthony Crescenzi, a bond strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. Another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with China, which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. The trade deficit and the shortfall with China "are big issues going forward".
