Instead of taxpayers having to pick up the bill, the FER wants Congressmen to change the PBGC's funding rules. It said it was "dismayed" at the situation and wants Congress to overturn the legislation. The PBGC was founded in 1974 to protect workers' retirement rights. "With a little firmer hand on the pensions issues in the US, I think that Congress could avoid having to turn to the taxpayer and instead turn the obligations back onto the companies that deserve to pay them," said Professor Dennis Logue, dean of Price College of Business at the University of Oklahoma. With United battling bankruptcy, the carrier had wanted to use the money set aside for pensions to finance running costs.
