The news surprised some analysts who had expected the latest minutes to show another unanimous decision. One member of the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) - Paul Tucker - voted to raise rates to 5%. The Bank's latest inflation report, released last week, had noted that the main reason inflation might fall was weaker consumer spending. He said the minutes appeared to be "trying to get the market to focus on the possibility of a rise in rates". "If the economy pans out as they expect then they are probably going to have to hike rates."
