FAO warns on impact of subsidiesBillions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism, the UN's Food & Agriculture Organisation has warned. Trade barriers and subsidies "severely" distort the market, the FAO report on the "State of Agricultural Commodity Markets 2004" said. It recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation. The first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. The FAO has urged the World Trade Organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market. For 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product.
