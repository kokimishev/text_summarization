Disney settles disclosure chargesWalt Disney has settled charges from US federal regulators that it failed to disclose how family members of directors were employed by the company. The firm has neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing in the settlement. Finally, Disney also did not reveal that it provided more than $200,000 annually for office space, secretarial services, and a leased car and driver to former director Thomas Murphy. Louise Bryson remains with Lifetime. "Shareholders have a significant interest in information regarding relationships between the company and its directors," said SEC deputy enforcement director Linda Thomsen.
