Telegraph newspapers axe 90 jobsThe Daily and Sunday Telegraph newspapers are axing 90 journalist jobs - 17% of their editorial staff. Journalists at the firm met on Friday afternoon to discuss how to react to the surprise announcement. The National Union of Journalists has called on the management to recall the notice of redundancy by midday on Monday or face a strike ballot. NUJ official Barry Fitzpatrick said the company had ignored the 90-day consultation period required for companies planning more than 10 redundancies. "Managers have torn up agreed procedures and kicked staff in the teeth by sacking people to pay for printing facilities," said Jeremy Dear, NUJ General Secretary. The Guardian is hedging its bets, planning a larger tabloid format like those popular in continental Europe. "However, action to improve our production capability and secure our titles against the competition is also vital."
