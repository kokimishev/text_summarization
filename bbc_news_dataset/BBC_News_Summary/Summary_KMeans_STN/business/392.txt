Euronext chief Jean-Francois Theodore is scheduled to meet his LSE counterpart Clara Furse on Friday. But it agreed to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a "significantly-improved proposal" would be in the interests of LSE's shareholders and customers. The LSE rejected Deutsche Boerse's proposed Â£1.3bn offer in December, saying it undervalued the business. In a statement on Thursday, Euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: "There can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made." A deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in Europe and the second biggest in the world after the New York Stock Exchange. The newspaper said the German suitor will offer to manage a combined cash and equities market out of London and let Ms Furse take the helm.
