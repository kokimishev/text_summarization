Google shares have risen since but fell $12.33 on Tuesday to close at $172.55. There were fears that the potential increase of shares in circulation from Tuesday would ease demand for stock. The restriction - known as a lockup - is being eased piecemeal: in all, some 227 million additional shares will become free to trade by February 2005. In its first earnings report since floating on the stock market, Google said it made a net profit of $52m in the three months ending 30 September. Google's main service - its internet search - is free to users, so the firm makes much of its money from selling advertising space linked to the words for which its users search.
