When automated phone message systems are taken out of the equation, where customers have to pick their way through multiple options and messages, the number of abandoned calls is even higher - a sixth of all callers give up rather than wait. Problems are occurring because increased responsibility is not going hand-in-hand with more training, the survey found. "Once a call centre may have looked after mortgages, now its agents may also be responsible for credit cards, insurance and current accounts," Ms Diemont says. The drop in patience comes as the number of calls to call centres is growing at a rate of 20% every year. As a result, call centres have a high "churn rate", with nearly a quarter of workers throwing in the towel every year, which in turn forces companies to pay for training new staff. However, companies that decide to "offshore" their operations are driven not just by cost considerations. Nearly two-thirds of all firms polled for the survey have no plans to offshore their call centres. What are your experiences with call centres?
