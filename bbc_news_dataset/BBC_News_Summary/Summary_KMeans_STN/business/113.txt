Vodafone's response to the Commission's letter was defiant. "However we will need time to examine the statement of objections in detail before we formally respond." "The Commission aims to ensure that European consumers are not overcharged when they use their mobile phones on their travels around the European Union," the Commission said in a statement. The Commission's investigation into Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile centres on the tariffs the two companies charge foreign mobile operators to access their networks when subscribers of those foreign operators use their mobile phones in Germany. Vodafone and O2, Britain's other big mobile phone operator, were sent similar statements of objections by the Commission in July last year. The investigation involves regulators assessing whether there is effective competition in the roaming market.
