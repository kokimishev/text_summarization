Jobs were created in every sector of the US economy except manufacturing. US adds more jobs than expectedThe US economy added 337,000 jobs in October - a seven-month high and far more than Wall Street expectations. In addition, the Labor Department revised up the number of jobs created in the two previous months - to 139,000 in September instead of 96,000, and to 198,000 in August instead of 128,000. "It looks like the job situation is improving and that this will support consumer spending going into the holidays, and offset some of the drag caused by high oil prices this year," said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards & Sons. There is also speculation that President Bush will deliberately try to keep the dollar low in order to assist a growth in exports.
