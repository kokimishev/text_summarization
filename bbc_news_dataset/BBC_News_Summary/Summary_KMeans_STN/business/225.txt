Sales in what is traditionally a strong month rose by 0.5% on a like-for-like basis, compared with a year earlier. Higher interest rates and uncertainty over the housing market continue to take their toll on the retail sector, the BRC said. "Following a relatively strong New Year's bank holiday, trading then took a downward turn," said Mr Hawkins. "Even extending some promotions and discounts and the pay-day boost later in the month could not tempt customers." And according to Office for National Statistics data, sales in December failed to meet expectations and by some counts were the worst since 1981.
