GM pays $2bn to evade Fiat buyoutGeneral Motors of the US is to pay Fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; Â£1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the Italian car maker outright. The firm is Italy's largest private employer, and a failure to reach an agreement could have had severe consequences for thousands of workers and for the Italian economy. Analysts said Fiat seemed to have done well out of the deal, although some predictions had expected a 2bn euro pay-off. "We needed scale in Europe to get costs down, and we were able to do that in working with Fiat," said GM chief executive Rick Wagoner. The relationship soured further after Fiat sold half its finance arm and recapitalised in 2003, halving GM's stake to 10%. The Fiat-GM alliance came about in 2000 as an alternative to selling Fiat outright.
