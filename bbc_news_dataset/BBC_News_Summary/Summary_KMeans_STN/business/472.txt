"Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next," said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website. Some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China.
