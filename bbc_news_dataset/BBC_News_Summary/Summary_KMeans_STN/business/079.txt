ID theft surge hits US consumersAlmost a quarter of a million US consumers complained of being targeted for identity theft in 2004, official figures suggest. The total cost of fraud reported by consumers was $546m (Â£290m). The report marks the fifth year in a row in which identity fraud has topped the table. Outside the field of ID theft, 53% of the near-400,000 complaints were internet-related. Catalogue and home-shopping frauds were next in line, accounting for 8% of total complaints, while concerns about internet services and computers - including spyware found on people's PCs and undisclosed charges for websites - amounted to 6% of complaints.
