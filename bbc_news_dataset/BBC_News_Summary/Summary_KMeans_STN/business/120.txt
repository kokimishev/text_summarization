Nigeria to boost cocoa productionThe government of Nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme. But with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. Cocoa was the main export product in Nigeria during the 1960s. However, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals. "The farmers in the village never see any assistance," he added. At the same time as Nigeria announced its new initiative, Ghana - the world's second largest cocoa exporter - announced revenues from the industry had broken new records.
