The deal was a "natural development" of its joint venture with United, said Tony Froggatt, S&N's chief executive. S&N will buy a 17.5% equity stake in United, maker of the well-known Kingfisher lager brand, and make a public offer to buy another 20% stake. Millennium Alcobev will now be merged with United, which expects post-merger to have about half of India's beer market. In addition to the equity stake S&N is to invest 2.47bn rupees in United through non-convertible redeemable preference shares. The airline, the brainchild of Mr Mallya, expects to start its operations by the end of April.
