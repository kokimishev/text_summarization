IMF agrees fresh Turkey fundingTurkey has agreed a draft proposal with the International Monetary Fund to borrow $10bn (Â£5.19bn), extending its ongoing financial support until 2007. Economic growth has average 6-7% in the past three years, ahead of IMF forecasts, while inflation fell below 10% this year for the first time in 30 years. The US, the largest of the IMF's 184 members, is a strong supporter of continued financial support for Turkey. Turkey's economy has steadily recovered from a severe crisis in 2001. The agreement would also enable Turkey to defer payments on previous loans worth $3.7m until 2006. "I believe the new programme, if implemented successfully, will help Turkey create the conditions for sustained growth and employment creation, reduce inflation toward European level and enhance the economy's resilience," he said.
