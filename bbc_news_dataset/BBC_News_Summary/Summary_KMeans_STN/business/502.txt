Algeria hit by further gas riotsAlgeria suffered a weekend of violent protests against government plans to raise gas prices, local press reports. Even before the hike, failing economic conditions had been fanning resentment in some of Algeria's poorest regions. Butane gas and fuel oil are used as the main source of fuel to heat homes and cook food in Algeria's remote mountain areas. Among the other main areas affected were the western Tiaret region and Sidi Ammar in the east of the country, Agence France Presse (AFP) reported.
