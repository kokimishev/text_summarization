EU 'too slow' on economic reformsMost EU countries have failed to put in place policies aimed at making Europe the world's most competitive economy by the end of the decade, a report says. The study, undertaken by the European Commission, sought to assess how far the EU has moved towards meeting its economic targets. In 2000, EU leaders at a summit in Lisbon pledged the European economy would outstrip that of the US by 2010. Among the biggest laggards, according to the report, are Greece and Italy. Many people expect the 2010 target to be quietly dropped.
