Car giant hit by Mercedes slumpA slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes' position as the world's most successful luxury brand. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. "The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment," said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman. However, it is expecting "significant improvements" in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.
