Executive trio leave Aer LingusThree senior executives of Ireland's state-owned airline, Aer Lingus, are set to leave early on 28 January after accusations of a conflict of interest. "I have opportunities open to me. Last Friday the minister had announced he was to advertise for three senior executives for Aer Lingus. "What I do after I leave Aer Lingus is still too early to say," Mr Walsh told AP news agency on Wednesday. He said he had received more than 40 business proposals, mostly aviation-related, since the trio announced their resignations two months ago. Brian and Seamus are in the equally fortunate position."
