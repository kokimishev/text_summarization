On 28 December, another senior economic adviser called the sale "the swindle of the century". Baikal promptly passed into the hands of state-controlled firm Rosneft, itself shortly to merge with state gas giant Gazprom. The assault on Yukos' assets has been widely blamed for a slowdown in economic growth in recent months. Many large Russian companies, particularly in the energy sector, use complex webs of offshore companies to avoid taxes. And he warned that using back taxes to deal with firms like Yukos - a technique now being applied by the Kremlin to several other firms - was a mistake. "I think that Rosneft and Yuganskneftegaz, should it become a state-owned company, must be privatized," he said. "We do not need simply to increase GDP, but to improve its structure."
