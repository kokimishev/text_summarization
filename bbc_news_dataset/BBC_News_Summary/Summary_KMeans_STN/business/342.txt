Chinese firms copy products ranging from computer software and spark plugs to baby milk and compact discs. Earlier this week China said that in future it will punish violators of intellectual property rights with up to seven years in jail. Between 1998 and 2002, the number of counterfeit or pirated goods intercepted at the EU's external borders increased by more than 800%, it said.

Other firms that have taken legal action in China, with varying degrees of success, include Yamaha, General Motors and Toyota. And it is growing.
