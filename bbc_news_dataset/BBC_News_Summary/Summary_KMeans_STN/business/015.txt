All EU-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the EU will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on Thursday. However, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to "extraordinary circumstances". The ERAA's Mr Clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. Airlines fear that "extraordinary circumstances" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. In addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation. New technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. "We reckon it has / it is going to cost European air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that has / that is over Â£1bn a year loaded onto European passengers," Mr Clarke said. "That's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted."
