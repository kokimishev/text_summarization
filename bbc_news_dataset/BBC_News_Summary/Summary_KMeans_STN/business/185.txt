US bank 'loses' customer detailsThe Bank of America has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are US federal employees. New York Senator Charles Schumer said he was told by the Senate Rules Committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane. The bank gave no details of how the records disappeared, but said they had probably not been misused. "Whether it is identity theft, terrorism, or other theft, in this new complicated world baggage handlers should have background checks and more care should be taken for who is hired for these increasingly sensitive positions," the Democrat senator said. About 900,000 military and civilian staff at the defence department are among the 1.2 million affected, according to a Pentagon spokesman.
