But its auto unit made a loss. Fourth quarter turnover was $44.7bn, compared to $45.9bn a year ago. In addition, the company said 2004 net income was affected by a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge taken to reduce the value of a receivable owed to Ford by Visteon, a former subsidiary. But Ford declined to provide guidance for first quarter 2005. "In 2004, our company gained momentum, delivering...more new products, and more innovative breakthroughs, such as the Escape Hybrid, the industry's first full-hybrid sport utility vehicle," said chairman and chief executive officer Bill Ford." Fourth-quarter vehicle unit sales totalled 1,751,000, a decline of 133,000 units.
