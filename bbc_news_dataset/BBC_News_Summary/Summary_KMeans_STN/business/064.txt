Lufthansa said that it may lose millions of euros as a result of Air Force One landing at Frankfurt airport. "We are doing research into the possibilities we have," Michael Lamberty, a Lufthansa spokesman told the BBC. "We are checking if there is action to be taken and in which courts it could be taken." Mr Lamberty said that 92 outgoing flights and 86 income flights were delayed by an average of an hour following President Bush's arrival, affecting almost 17,000 passengers. The extra time taken by President Bush and his entourage meant that there was a knock-on effect that led to significant delays.
