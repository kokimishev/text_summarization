Survey confirms property slowdownGovernment figures have confirmed a widely reported slowdown of the UK's housing market in late 2004. House prices rose the slowest in Greater London, being up by 6%. In the capital, the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36,185 in 2003 to 28,041 for the same period in 2004. However, the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions, including cash sales. The government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. After registering falls at the back end of 2004, Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year.
