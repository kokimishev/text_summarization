The higher share prices also reflect relief that a clear winner has emerged from what proved to be a tight poll. "I would look at the stock market rally for Bush as kind of a one-day event," said Ken Mayland at Clearview Economics. Some analysts predicted that the jump in share prices would be short-lived, saying investors would quickly focus once again on the health of the US economy. President Bush has placed reform of the pensions system at the heart of his economic agenda for a second term. The US' recent economic performance has been mixed, with solid growth offset by disappointingly low job creation figures, and mounting worries over a record budget deficit. Share prices in London, Frankfurt and Paris also closed higher. Senator Kerry attacked President Bush's economic record during his campaign, hammering home the fact that a net 800,000 jobs were lost during his term in office.
