"The economy is now heading upward rather than downward," said central bank governor Park Seung. Consumer confidence has bounced back from a four-year low in January, and retail sales were up 2.1% in December. Economic growth in 2004 was about 4.7%, with the central bank predicting 4% growth this year. The country's economy has suffered from an overhang of personal debt after its consumers' credit card spending spree. But domestic demand seems to be taking up the slack. One of its biggest card issuers, LG Card, was rescued from collapse in December, having almost imploded under the weight of its customers' bad debts.
