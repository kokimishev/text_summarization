GMAC has been a strong contributor to profits in 2004 but GM said it will do less well this year, delivering net income of $2.5bn. GM said it was expecting "reduced financial losses" in Europe in 2005. The biggest job losses are in Germany. Its vehicle businesses have gained market share in three out of four regions in 2004, achieving record profitability in Asia Pacific and returning to profit in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. "We're following a roadmap that we believe will deliver strong results," said GM chief executive Rick Waggoner.
