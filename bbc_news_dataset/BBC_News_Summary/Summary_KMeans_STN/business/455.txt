Despite making a record Australian dollars 648m ($492m) profit last year, Qantas has argued that it needs to make considerable savings if it is to remain competitive. More than 90% of the airline's staff are based in Australia. Unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying Qantas was profitable. "We're going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas," the newspaper quoted Qantas chief executive Geoff Dixon as saying. In an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers, Qantas sought a tie-up with Air New Zealand last year However, the deal was thrown out by the New Zealand High Court on competition grounds. "Qantas announced a record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary."
