However, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. Gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. However, the economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. Japan's economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession. "The economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage," said Economic and Fiscal Policy Minister Heizo Takenaka. Ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter.
