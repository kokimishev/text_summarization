Takeover rumour lifts Exel sharesShares in storage and delivery firm Exel closed up 9% at a two-and-a-half year high on Tuesday on speculation it is to receive an imminent takeover bid. The talk in the City is that US giant United Parcel Services (UPS) is the most likely bidder for the firm. Exel employs 109,000 people in more than 120 countries and has itself been active in the consolidation of the logistics sector, paying Â£328m to buy fellow UK firm Tibbett & Britten last August. "Both are interested in expanding in logistics and you can make a decent case for cost synergies which could justify the premium and that has / that is before you make any argument about revenue synergies."
