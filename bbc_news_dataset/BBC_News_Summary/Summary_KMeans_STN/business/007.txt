The Labor Department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in December 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000. He presided over a net fall in jobs up to last November's Presidential election - the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover. However, when adding December and January's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory. "The economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth," said Ken Mayland, president of ClearView Economics. "That means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers."
