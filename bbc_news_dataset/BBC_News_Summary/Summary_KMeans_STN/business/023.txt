Mixed signals from French economyThe French economy picked up speed at the end of 2004, official figures show - but still looks set to have fallen short of the government's hopes. Also on Friday, France's industrial output for December was released, showing 0.7% growth. "The numbers are good," said David Naude, economist at Deutsche Bank. It leaves GDP up 2.3% for the full year, but short of the 2.5% which the French government had predicted. "They send a positive signal of a rebound in output... and open the way for a continuation in that trend into the New Year."
