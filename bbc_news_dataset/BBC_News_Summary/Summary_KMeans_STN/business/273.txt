In London, the benchmark Brent crude price closed down 51 cents at $44.38 a barrel, while New York light sweet crude closed down 25 cents at $48.64 a barrel. G20 finance ministers said nothing about supporting the dollar, whose slide could further jeopardise growth in Japan and Europe. And last week US Treasury Secretary John Snow told an audience in the UK that the policy remained unaltered. For the US government, letting the dollar drift is a useful short-term fix. But Mr Snow made clear exchange rates had not been on the agenda. "It seems persuasive that, given the size of the US current account deficit, a diminished appetite for adding to dollar balances must occur at some point," he said. Similarly, Asian investment helps bridge the gap in the current account - the deficit between what the US as a whole spends and what it earns.
