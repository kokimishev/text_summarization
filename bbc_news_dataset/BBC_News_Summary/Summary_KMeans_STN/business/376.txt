Dollar slides ahead of New YearThe US dollar has hit a new record low against the euro and analysts predict that more declines are likely in 2005. Against the yen the dollar was trading down at $103.05. Earlier on Thursday, the Japanese yen touched its lowest versus the euro on concerns about economic growth in Asia. It later strengthened to 140.55. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its index dropped to 61.2, more than analysts had expected. "People want to go into the weekend and the New Year positioned for a weaker buck," said Tim Mazanec, director of foreign exchange at Investors Bank and Trust.
