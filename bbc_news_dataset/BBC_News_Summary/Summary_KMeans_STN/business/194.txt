The CML said gross mortgage lending stood at £17.9bn, compared with £21.8bn in January last year. Both the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) and Building Society Association (BSA) said lending was down sharply. This was a return to the "weaker pattern" of lending seen in the last months of 2004, the BBA added. However, it is the year-on-year lending comparisons which are the most striking.
