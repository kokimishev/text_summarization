MCI shares climb on takeover bidShares in US phone company MCI have risen on speculation that it is in takeover talks. The largest US telephone company Verizon has previously held preliminary merger discussions with MCI, Reuters quoted sources as saying. Shares in MCI, which changed its name from Worldcom when it emerged from bankruptcy, were up 2.4% at $20.15. It hit the headlines as Worldcom in 2002 after admitting it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. MCI was renamed after it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April last year. The scandal was a key factor in a global slide in share prices and the reverberations are still being felt today.
