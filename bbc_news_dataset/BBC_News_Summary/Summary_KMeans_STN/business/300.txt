J&J agrees $25bn Guidant dealPharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm Guidant for $25.4bn (Â£13bn). Analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting Johnson & Johnson's reliance on a slowing drug business. Stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked. The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price.
