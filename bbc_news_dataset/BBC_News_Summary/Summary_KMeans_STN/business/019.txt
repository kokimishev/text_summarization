Investment bank Morgan Stanley has forecast that India's mobile market is likely to grow by about 40% a year until 2007. Key positions, such as those of chief executive, chief technology officer and chief financial officer are to be held by Indians, he added. "It is a positive development for carriers and the investment community, looking to take a longer-term view of the huge growth in the Indian telecoms market," said Gartner's principal analyst Kobita Desai. The decision to raise the limit for foreign investors faced considerable opposition from the communist parties, which give crucial support to the coalition headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Analysts and investors have welcomed the government decision.
