Deutsche Bank claimed Yukos had artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. Deutsche Bank contends Yukos filed for bankruptcy earlier this month in Texas in a desperate and unsuccessful bid to stave off the 19 December auction of its top unit by the Russian government, which was in a tax dispute with Yukos. Mike Lake, a spokesman for Yukos' lawyers, said on Tuesday that the company stands by its legal action. The effect of these transactions is to renationalise Yuganskneftegas. Yukos is confident of its right to US bankruptcy protection, and "we are prepared to be back in court defending that position again," he said. But the US bankruptcy court judge in Texas granted Yukos an injunction that barred Gazprom and its lenders from taking part. In its filing, Deutsche Bank said Houston was "a jurisdiction in which Yukos owns no real or personal property and conducts no business operations."
