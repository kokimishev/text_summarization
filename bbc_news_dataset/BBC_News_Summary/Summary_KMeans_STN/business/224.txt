"Any board has a responsibility to consider a bona fide offer proposal," the club said in its statement. Manchester United's response comes as little surprise, as the board made clear. A group of five MPs are calling on the Department of Trade and Industry to block any takeover of the club by the US football magnate on public interest grounds. Should it become a firm offer, it should be at a price that "the board is likely to regard as fair" and on terms which "may be deliverable". Many of Manchester United's supporters own shares in the club, and the fan-based group Shareholders United is strongly opposed to any takeover by Mr Glazer. Pitched at 300p per share, it also relies less on debt to finance it than an earlier approach from the US tycoon, which was rejected out of hand. But it also stressed that it stayed opposed to Mr Glazer's proposal.
