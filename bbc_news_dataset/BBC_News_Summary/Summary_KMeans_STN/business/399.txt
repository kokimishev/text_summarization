It was forced to sell its key production unit Yuganskneftegas (Yugansk) last month after being hit with a bill of $27bn in unpaid taxes and fines. India produces about 793,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), little changed since the start of the 1990s, according to oil industry analysts Douglas-Westwood. India imports about 70% of its total oil consumption. "We forecast that Indian production will go into significant decline," Mr Westwood said. Yukos has been battling the Russian authorities for more than a year and has filed for bankruptcy protection in the US. The dispute is partly driven by President Putin's clampdown on the political ambitions of ex-Yukos boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in jail on charges of fraud and tax evasion. ONGC, which is majority-owned by the Indian state, already has bought petroleum assets in countries including Vietnam, Sudan and Russia. ONGC's interest is the latest twist in a saga that has seen one of the world's biggest oil producers brought to its knees.
