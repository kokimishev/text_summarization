LG Card's creditors have given LG group until Wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. It says it wants "fair and reasonable guidelines" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of LG Card. The firm returned to profit in September 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the Korea Stock Exchange. LG Group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. "LG Group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of LG Card," said Kim Yungmin, an equity strategist at Dongwon Investment Trust Management. The exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running.
