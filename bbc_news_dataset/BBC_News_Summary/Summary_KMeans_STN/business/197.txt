Krivorizhstal is one of dozens of firms which he says were sold cheaply to friends of the previous administration. President Viktor Yushchenko, elected in December, is planning to revisit many of Ukraine's recent privatisations. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said as many as 3,000 firms could be included on the list of firms whose sale was being reviewed. Analysts have suggested that the government needs to avoid the impression of an open-ended list, so as to preserve investor confidence. The next step is for the supreme court to annul the sale altogether, opening the way for Krivorizhstal to be resold.
