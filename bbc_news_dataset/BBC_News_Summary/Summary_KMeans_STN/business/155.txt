The two companies, facing competition from the likes of Wal-Mart, tried to merge two years ago but talks failed. Federated has annual sales of $15.6bn, while May's yearly sales are $14.4bn. Sources familiar with the deal said that negotiations between the two companies sped up after May's chairman and chief executive Gene Kahn resigned in January. Some analysts see the merger as a rescue deal for May. "Without this deal May would have been, to put it bluntly, washed up," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Consulting Group.
