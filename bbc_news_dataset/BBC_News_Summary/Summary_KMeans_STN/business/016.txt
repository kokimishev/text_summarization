There were also fears that too much stress might be placed on the fragile banking system. The breakneck pace of economic expansion has kept growth above 9% for more than a year. A low exchange rate - China's yuan is pegged to a rate of 8.28 to the dollar, which seems to be in relentless decline - means Chinese exports are cheap on world markets. In theory, the government has a 7% growth target, but continues to insist that the overshoot does not mean a "hard landing" in the shape of an overbalancing economy. China has thus far resisted international pressure to break the link or at least to shift the level of its peg.
