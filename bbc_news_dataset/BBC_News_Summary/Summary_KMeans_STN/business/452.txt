McDonald's boss Bell dies aged 44Charlie Bell, the straight-talking former head of fast-food giant McDonald's, has died of cancer aged 44. Mr Bell leaves a wife and daughter. He resigned in November to fight the illness. "No matter what cards life dealt, Charlie stayed centred on his love for his family and for McDonald's." After running the company's Australian business in the 1990s, Mr Bell moved to the US in 1999 to run operations in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Mr Bell oversaw McDonald's "I am lovin' it" advertising campaign and introduced successes such as McCafe, now the biggest coffee shop brand in Australia and New Zealand.
