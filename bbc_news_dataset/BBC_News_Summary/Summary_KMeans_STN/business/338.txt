Police detain Chinese milk bossesChinese police have detained three top executives at milk firm Yili, with reports suggesting that they are being investigated for embezzlement. Yili - full name Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial - confirmed its chairman, chief financial officer and securities representative were all in custody. The official Xinhua News Agency said the arrest was linked to alleged embezzlement. The company and its two main rivals - market leader Mengniu Dairy and second place Bright Dairy - dominate a Chinese milk market that has grown by almost 30% over the past five years. "Investors wonder if Yili's scandal, one of a slew to be uncovered this year, is not just the tip of the iceberg," said Chen Huiqin, an analyst at Huatai Securities.
